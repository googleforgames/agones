Agones supports and is tested against 3 releases of Kubernetes, targeting the newest version as being the [default version in the GKE Rapid channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes#current_versions). The vendored version of client-go will be aligned with the middle of the three supported Kubernetes versions ({version_2}). All the example clusters will use the middle of the three supported Kubernetes versions ({version_2}).

List of items to do for upgrading to {version_1} {version_2} {version_3}

- [ ] Update the cluster version of terraform submodules in `install/terraform/modules`
    - [ ] Update Kubernetes version of GKE cluster (both `gke` and `gke-autopilot`) to {version_2}
    - [ ] Update Kubernetes version of AKS to the newest supported version in {version_1} {version_2} {version_3}
    - [ ] Update Kubernetes version of EKS to the newest supported version in {version_1} {version_2} {version_3}
- [ ] Update kubectl in dev tooling to {version_2}, the latest patch version can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/releases/)
    - [ ] Update kubectl in `build/build-image/Dockerfile`
    - [ ] Update kubectl in `build/e2e-image/Dockerfile`
- [ ] Update the Kubernetes version of the below test clusters to {version_2}
    - [ ] Minikube in `build/includes/minikube.mk` (Get the patch version [here](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) since minikube supports the latest Kubernetes release)
    - [ ] Kind in `build/includes/kind.mk` (Confirm {version_2} is supported and get the patch version [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases))
- [ ] Update the k8s image used in the helm [pre-delete-hook](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/install/helm/agones/templates/hooks/pre_delete_hook.yaml) to {version_2} (Get the patch version [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/lachlanevenson/k8s-kubectl))
- [ ] Update client-go in `go.mod` and `test/terraform/go.mod` to {version_2} by running `go get -u k8s.io/client-go@{CORRESPONDING_VERSION}` and `go get -u k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver@{CORRESPONDING_VERSION}`, then re-run `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor`
- [ ] Update CRD API reference to {version_2}
    - [ ] Update links to k8s documentation in `site/assets/templates/crd-doc-config.json`
    - [ ] Regenerate crd api reference docs - `make gen-api-docs`
    - [ ] Regenerate crd client libraries - `make gen-crd-client`
- [ ] Regenerate Kubernetes resource includes (e.g. ObjectMeta, PodTemplateSpec)
    - [ ] Start a cluster with `make gcloud-test-cluster` (this cluster will use Kubernetes {version_2}), uninstall agones using `helm uninstall agones -n agones-system`, and then run  `make gen-embedded-openapi` and `make gen-install`
- [ ] Update documentation for creating clusters and k8s API references to align with the above clusters versions and the k8s API version
    - [ ] `site/config.toml`
        - [ ] `dev_supported_k8s`, which are {version_1} {version_2} {version_3}
        - [ ] `dev_k8s_api_version`, which is {version_2}
        - [ ] `dev_gke_example_cluster_version`, which is {version_2}
        - [ ] `dev_aks_example_cluster_version`, which is the newest AKS supported version in {version_1} {version_2} {version_3}
        - [ ] `dev_eks_example_cluster_version`, which is the newest EKS supported version in {version_1} {version_2} {version_3}
        - [ ] `dev_minikube_example_cluster_version`, which is {version_2} with the supported patch version
- [ ] If client-go pulled in a new version of gRPC, then also
    - [ ] Update the SDK [base image grpc version](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/build/includes/sdk.mk#L30) and rebuild the image. Note that this can take a while and in the past we have had to manually push it to gcr because cloud build doesn't like how long it takes.
    - [ ] Regenerate allocated API endpoints: [make gen-allocation-grpc](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/build/includes/allocation.mk#L55)
    - [ ] Regenerate all client sdks: [make gen-all-sdk-grpc](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/build/README.md#make-gen-all-sdk-grpc)
    - [ ] Update the version number in C++ Cmake scripts [here](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/sdks/cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L100) and [here](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/sdks/cpp/cmake/prerequisites.cmake#L34)
- [ ] Confirm the update works as expected by running e2e tests
    - [ ] Add the new supported Kubernetes versions to the e2e clusters creation
        - [ ] In `terraform/e2e/module.tf`, add the new supported version to the map `kubernetes_versions_standard` and `kubernetes_versions_autopilot`. Noted the location of the new clusters should have enough quota (CPU, In-use IP addresses) to create the cluster. And the new supported version is usually only available in RAPID channel.
        - [ ] Recreate clusters with new scripts: `cd build; make GCP_PROJECT=agones-images gcloud-e2e-test-cluster`
    - [ ] Update the Cloud Build configuration to run e2e test on the new created clusters, and disable the e2e test on the cluster with the oldest supported K8s version
        - [ ] Update the `versionsAndRegions` variable to add the new supported version and remove the oldest supported K8s version in `cloudbuild.yaml` `submit-e2e-test-cloud-build` step
        - [ ] Submit a PR to trigger the e2e tests and verfiy they all pass
    - [ ] After the PR that includes the above Cloud Build configuration change has been merged and all the existing pending PRs in the Cloud Build queue have picked up the new configuration, submit a separate PR to update the e2e clusters terraform module to remove the e2e cluster with the oldest supported K8s version.
        - [ ] In `terraform/e2e/module.tf`, remove the oldest supported version from the map `kubernetes_versions_standard` and `kubernetes_versions_autopilot`.
        - [ ] Destroy the old clusters with new scripts: `cd build; make GCP_PROJECT=agones-images gcloud-e2e-test-cluster`
