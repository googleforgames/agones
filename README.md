Agones is a library for hosting, running and scaling [dedicated game servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server#Dedicated_server) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

_Agones, is derived from the Greek word agōn which roughly translates to “contest”, “competition at games” and “gathering”.
([source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agones))_

## Why does this project exist?
Agones replaces usual bespoke or proprietary cluster management and game server scaling solutions with a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster
that includes the Agones custom _[Kubernetes Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers)_ and matching [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) for _GameServers_, _Fleets_ and more.

With Agones, Kubernetes gets native abilities to create, run, manage and scale dedicated game server processes within Kubernetes clusters using standard Kubernetes tooling and APIs. This model also allows any matchmaker to interact directly with Agones via the Kubernetes API to provision a dedicated game server.

For more details on why this project was written, read the
[announcement blog post](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/03/introducing-Agones-open-source-multiplayer-dedicated-game-server-hosting-built-on-Kubernetes.html).

## Major Features
- Define a single `GameServer`, and/or large game server `Fleets` within Kubernetes - either through yaml or via the API
- Manage GameServer lifecycles - including health checking and connection information.
- `Fleet` Autoscaling capabilities that integrate with Kubernetes' native cluster autoscaling
- Gameserver specific metric exports and dashboards for ops teams

## Usage
