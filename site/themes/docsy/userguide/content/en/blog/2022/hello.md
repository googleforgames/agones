## Hello

It may seem strange to see a "Hello" post from a project that's several years old, but as Docsy matures as a community-driven project, we thought it was time to (re)introduce ourselves and talk about what's new with your favorite (we hope) Hugo documentation theme!

### Discuss amongst yourselves

Our [Discussions](https://github.com/google/docsy/discussions) are really hopping lately! Don't miss our notice of the [upcoming deprecation of the Font-Awesome and Bootstrap git submodules](https://github.com/google/docsy/discussions/950) or our announcement of our [new governance model](https://github.com/google/docsy/discussions/798)!

### Milestones, releases, and roadmaps

We are planning our first official release of Docsy soonâ€”check out the [milestones for 0.2.0](https://github.com/google/docsy/milestone/2). Got a suggestion for the roadmap? Open an [issue](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues).

### Coming soon: project metrics

Starting next month, we'll publish project metrics here on this blog.

### Introducing the PSC

Docsy now has a Project Steering Committee! The PSC members are [@chalin][], [@LisaFC][], [@geriom][], and [@emckean][]. If you're interested in serving on the PSC, open an [issue](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues) and nominate yourself!
