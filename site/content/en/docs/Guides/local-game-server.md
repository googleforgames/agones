  Register your local game server with Agones.
---

You can register a local game server with Agones. This means you can run an experimental build of your game server in the Agones environment without the need of packaging and deploying it to a fleet. This allows you to quickly iterate on your game server code while still being able to plugin to your Agones environment.

This can be used in combination with a [local SDK Server]({{< ref "./Client SDKs/local.md" >}}) in ["out of cluster" mode]({{< ref "./Client SDKs/local.md#running-locally-using-out-of-cluster-mode" >}}).

## Register your server with Agones

To register your local game server you'll need to know the IP address of the machine running it and the port. With that you'll create a game server config like the one below.

```yaml
apiVersion: "agones.dev/v1"
kind: GameServer
metadata:
  name: my-local-server
  annotations:
    # Causes Agones to register your local game server at 192.1.1.2, replace with your server's IP address.
    agones.dev/dev-address: "192.1.1.2"
spec:
  ports:
  - name: default
    portPolicy: Static
    hostPort: 17654
    containerPort: 17654
  # The following is ignored but required due to validation.
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: simple-game-server
        image: {{< example-image >}}
```

Once you save this to a file make sure you have `kubectl` configured to point to your Agones cluster and then run `kubectl apply -f dev-gameserver.yaml`. This will register your server with Agones.

Local Game Servers has a few limitations:

 * PortPolicy must be `Static`.
 * The game server is not managed by Agones. Features like autoscaling, replication, etc are not available.

When you are finished working with your server, you can remove the registration with `kubectl delete -f dev-gameserver.yaml`
