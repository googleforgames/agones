Check the [Client SDK Documentation]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}) for more details on each of the SDK functions and how to run the SDK locally.

Additional methods have been added for ease of use:

- Connect

{{% feature publishVersion="1.19.0" %}}
## Installation

The client SDK code can be manually downloaded and added to your project hierarchy.

It can also be imported into your project via the Unity Package Manager (UPM). To do that, open your project's `manifest.json` file, and add the following line to the dependencies section:

```
{
  "dependencies": {
        "com.googleforgames.agones": "https://github.com/googleforgames/agones.git?path=/sdks/unity",
...
```

If you want a specific release, the dependency can be pinned to that version. For example: 

`"com.googleforgames.agones": "https://github.com/googleforgames/agones.git?path=/sdks/unity#1.19.0",`
{{% feature publishVersion="1.19.0" %}}

## Download

Download the source {{< ghlink href="sdks/unity" >}}directly from GitHub{{< /ghlink >}}.

## Prerequisites

- Unity >= 2018.x (.NET 4.x)

## Usage

Import this script to your unity project and attach it to GameObject.

To begin working with the SDK, get an instance of it.

```csharp
var agones = agonesGameObject.GetComponent<Agones.AgonesSdk>();
```

To connect to the SDK server, either local or when running on Agones, run the async `Connect()` method.
This will wait for up to 30 seconds if the SDK server has not yet started and the connection cannot be made,
and will return `false` if there was an issue connecting.

```csharp
bool ok = await agones.Connect();
```

To mark the game server as [ready to receive player connections]({{< relref "_index.md#ready" >}}), call the async method `Ready()`.

```csharp
async void SomeMethod()
{
    bool ok = await agones.Ready();
}
```

To get the details on the [backing `GameServer`]({{< relref "_index.md#gameserver" >}}) call `GameServer()`.

Will return `null` if there is an error in retrieving the `GameServer` record.

```csharp
var gameserver = await agones.GameServer();
```

To mark the GameServer as [Reserved]({{< relref "_index.md#reserveseconds" >}}) for a duration call 
`Reserve(TimeSpan duration)`.

```csharp
ok = await agones.Reserve(duration);
```

To mark that the [game session is completed]({{< relref "_index.md#shutdown" >}}) and the game server should be shut down call `Shutdown()`.

```csharp
bool ok = await agones.Shutdown();
```

Similarly `SetAnnotation(string key, string value)` and `SetLabel(string key, string value)` are async methods that perform an action.

And there is no need to call `Health()`, it is automatically called.

To watch when 
[the backing `GameServer` configuration changes]({{< relref "_index.md#watchgameserverfunctiongameserver" >}})
call `WatchGameServer(callback)`, where the delegate function `callback` will be executed every time the `GameServer` 
configuration changes.

```csharp
agones.WatchGameServer(gameServer => Debug.Log($"Server - Watch {gameServer}"));
```

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning"%}}
The following code causes deadlock. Do not use a `Wait` method with the returned Task.
```csharp
void Deadlock()
{
    Task<bool> t = agones.Shutdown();
    t.Wait(); // deadlock!!!
}
```
{{% /alert %}}

## Settings

The properties for the Unity Agones SDK can be found in the Inspector.

- Health Interval Second
  - Interval of the server sending a health ping to the Agones sidecar. (default: `5`)
- Health Enabled
  - Whether the server sends a health ping to the Agones sidecar. (default: `true`)
- Log Enabled
  - Debug Logging Enabled. Debug logging for development of this Plugin. (default: `false`)
