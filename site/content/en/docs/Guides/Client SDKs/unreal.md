Additional methods have been added for ease of use (both of which are enabled by default):

- Connect
  - will call `/gameserver` till a succesful response is returned and then call `/ready`.
  - disabled by setting `bDisableAutoConnect` to `true`.
  - An event is broadcast with the `GameServer` data once the `/gameserver` call succeeds.
- Health
  - calls `/health` endpoint on supplied rate
  - enabled by default with 10 second rate
  - disabled by default by setting `HealthRateSeconds` to `0`.

Both of the above are automatically kicked off in the `BeginPlay` of the component.

## Resources

[Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/) is a [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) that is used by anyone from hobbyists all the way through to huge AAA Game Stuidos.

With this in mind there is a vast amount to learn to run a production game using Unreal, even before you get to learning how it integrates with Agones. If you want to kick the tires with a starter project you will probably be fine with one of the starter projects out of the box.

However as your Unreal/Agones project gets more advanced you will want to understand more about the engine itself and how it can be used to integrate with this project. There will be different ways of interacting via in Play In Editor (PIE) versus running as an actual dedicated game server packaged into a container.

There are few helpful links for latest Unreal Engine 5:

- [UE5 Game Mode API Reference](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AGameMode/)
  - useful for hooking up calls to Agones
- [UE5 Game Session API Reference](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AGameSession/)
  - as above there are hooks in Game Session that can be used to call into Agones

  - only building out Unreal game servers / clients, will also need to package into a container

## Getting Started

This is a SDK inspired by the REST API to the Agones sidecars that allows engineers to communicate with the sidecar from either C++ or Blueprints.

### Getting the Code

Easiest way to get this code is to clone the repository and drop the entire plugin folder into your own `Plugins` folder. This runs the plugin as a Project plugin rather than an engine plugin.

We could however turn this into a marketplace plugin that can be retrived from the marketplace directly into the UE editor.

#### Using C++ (UE5/UE4)
- Add Plugin (in your own `.uproject` file)
```json
  "Plugins": [
    {
      "Enabled": true,
      "Name": "Agones"
    }
  ],
```
- Add Plugin (in your own `*.Build.cs`)
```json
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(
    new[]
    {
        "Agones",
    });
```
- Add component in header
```c++
#include "AgonesComponent.h"

UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
UAgonesComponent* AgonesSDK;
```
- Initialize component in GameMode
```c++
#include "AgonesComponent.h"
#include "Classes.h"

ATestGameMode::ATestGameMode()
{
	AgonesSDK = CreateDefaultSubobject<UAgonesComponent>(TEXT("AgonesSDK"));
}
```

- Use the Agones component to call PlayerReady
```c++
void APlatformGameSession::PostLogin(APlayerController* NewPlayer)
{
  // Empty brances are for callbacks on success and errror.
  AgonesSDK->PlayerConnect("netspeak-player", {}, {});
}
```

#### Using Blueprints (UE5)
- Add Component to your Blueprint GameMode
![component](../../../../images/unreal5_bp_component.png)
- This will automatically call `/health` every 10 seconds and once `/gameserver` calls are succesful it will call `/ready`.

- Accessing other functionality of Agones can be done via adding a node in Blueprints.
![actions](../../../../images/unreal5_bp_actions.png)

#### Using Blueprints (UE4)
- Add Component to your Blueprint GameMode
![component](../../../../images/unreal_bp_component.png)
- This will automatically call `/health` every 10 seconds and once `/gameserver` calls are succesful it will call `/ready`.

- Accessing other functionality of Agones can be done via adding a node in Blueprints.

## Configuration Options

A number of options can be altered via config files in Unreal these are supplied via `Game` configuration eg. `DefaultGame.ini`.

```
[/Script/Agones.AgonesComponent]
HttpPort=1337
HealthRateSeconds=5.0
bDisableAutoConnect=true
```

## Unreal Hooks

Within the Unreal [GameMode](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AGameMode/index.html) and [GameSession](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AGameSession/index.html) exist a number of useful existing
funtions that can be used to fit in with making calls out to Agones.

A few examples are:
- `RegisterServer` to call `SetLabel`, `SetPlayerCapacity`
- `PostLogin` to call `PlayerConnect`
- `NotifyLogout` to call `PlayerDisconnect`
