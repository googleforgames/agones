## Overview

The client SDKs are required for a game server to work with Agones.

The current supported SDKs are:

- [Unreal Engine]({{< relref "unreal.md" >}})
- [Unity]({{< relref "unity.md" >}})
- [C++]({{< relref "cpp.md" >}})
- [C#]({{< relref "csharp.md" >}})
- [Node.js]({{< relref "nodejs.md" >}})
- [Go]({{< relref "go.md" >}})
- [Rust]({{< relref "rust.md" >}})
- [REST]({{< relref "rest.md" >}})

You can also find some externally supported SDKs in our 
[Third Party Content]({{% ref "/docs/Third Party Content/libraries-tools.md#client-sdks" %}}).

The SDKs are relatively thin wrappers around [gRPC](https://grpc.io) generated clients,
or an implementation of the REST API (exposed via [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)), 
where gRPC client generation and compilation isn't well supported.

They connect to a small process that Agones coordinates to run alongside the Game Server
in a Kubernetes [`Pod`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/).
This means that more languages can be supported in the future with minimal effort
(but pull requests are welcome! ðŸ˜Š ).

There is also [local development tooling]({{< relref "local.md" >}}) for working against the SDK locally,
without having to spin up an entire Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Connecting to the SDK Server

Starting with Agones 1.1.0, the port that the SDK Server listens on for incoming gRPC or HTTP requests is
configurable. This provides flexibility in cases where the default port conflicts with a port that is needed
by the game server.

Agones will automatically set the following environment variables on all game server containers:

* `AGONES_SDK_GRPC_PORT`: The port where the gRPC server is listening (defaults to 9357)
* `AGONES_SDK_HTTP_PORT`: The port where the grpc-gateway is listening (defaults to 9358)

The SDKs will automatically discover and connect to the gRPC port specified in the environment variable.

If your game server requires using a REST client, it is advised to use the port from the environment variable,
otherwise your game server will not be able to contact the SDK server if it is configured to use a non-default port.

## Function Reference

While each of the SDKs are canonical to their languages, they all have the following
functions that implement the core responsibilities of the SDK.

For language specific documentation, have a look at the respective source (linked above), 
and the {{< ghlink href="examples" >}}examples{{< /ghlink >}}.

Calling any of state changing functions mentioned below does not guarantee that GameServer Custom Resource object would actually change its state right after the call. For instance, it could be moved to the `Shutdown` state elsewhere (for example, when a fleet scales down), which leads to no changes in `GameServer` object. You can verify the result of this call by waiting for the desired state in a callback to WatchGameServer() function.

Functions which changes GameServer state or settings are:

1. Ready()
2. Shutdown()
3. SetLabel()
4. SetAnnotation()
5. Allocate()
6. Reserve()
7. Alpha().SetCapacity()
8. Alpha().PlayerConnect()
9. Alpha().PlayerDisconnect()
10. Alpha().SetCounterCount()
11. Alpha().IncrementCounter()
12. Alpha().DecrementCounter()
13. Alpha().SetCounterCapacity()
14. Alpha().AppendListValue()
15. Alpha().DeleteListValue()
16. Alpha().SetListCapacity()

### Lifecycle Management

#### Ready()
This tells Agones that the Game Server is ready to take player connections.
Once a Game Server has specified that it is `Ready`, then the Kubernetes
GameServer record will be moved to the `Ready` state, and the details
for its public address and connection port will be populated.

While Agones prefers that `Shutdown()` is run once a game has completed to delete the `GameServer` instance,
if you want or need to move an `Allocated` `GameServer` back to `Ready` to be reused, you can call this SDK method again to do
this.

#### Health()
This sends a single ping to designate that the Game Server is alive and
healthy. Failure to send pings within the configured thresholds will result
in the GameServer being marked as `Unhealthy`. 

See the {{< ghlink href="examples/gameserver.yaml" >}}gameserver.yaml{{< /ghlink >}} for all health checking
configurations.

#### Reserve(seconds)

With some matchmaking scenarios and systems it is important to be able to ensure that a `GameServer` is unable to be deleted,
but doesn't trigger a FleetAutoscaler scale up. This is where `Reserve(seconds)` is useful.

`Reserve(seconds)` will move the `GameServer` into the Reserved state for the specified number of seconds (0 is forever), and then it will be
moved back to `Ready` state. While in `Reserved` state, the `GameServer` will not be deleted on scale down or `Fleet` update,
and also it could not be Allocated using [GameServerAllocation]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" >}}).

This is often used when a game server process must register itself with an external system, such as a matchmaker,
that requires it to designate itself as available for a game session for a certain period. Once a game session has started,
it should call `SDK.Allocate()` to designate that players are currently active on it.

Calling other state changing SDK commands such as `Ready` or `Allocate` will turn off the timer to reset the `GameServer` back
to the `Ready` state or to promote it to an `Allocated` state accordingly.

#### Allocate()

With some matchmakers and game matching strategies, it can be important for game servers to mark themselves as `Allocated`.
For those scenarios, this SDK functionality exists.

There is a chance that GameServer does not actually become `Allocated` after this call. Please refer to the general note in [Function Reference](#function-reference) above.

The `agones.dev/last-allocated` annotation will be set on the GameServer to an RFC3339 formatted timestamp of the time of allocation, even if the GameServer was already in an `Allocated` state.

Note that if using `SDK.Allocate()` in combination with [GameServerAllocation]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" >}})s, it's possible for the `agones.dev/last-allocated` timestamp to move backwards if clocks are not synchronized between the Agones controller and the GameServer pod.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
Using a [GameServerAllocation]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" >}}) is preferred in all other scenarios, 
as it gives Agones control over how packed `GameServers` are scheduled within a cluster, whereas with `Allocate()` you
relinquish control to an external service which likely doesn't have as much information as Agones.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Shutdown()
This tells Agones to shut down the currently running game server. The GameServer state will be set `Shutdown` and the 
backing Pod will be Terminated.

It's worth reading the [Termination of Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination)
Kubernetes documentation, to understand the termination process, and the related configuration options.

As a rule of thumb, implement a graceful shutdown in your game sever process when it receives the TERM signal
from Kubernetes when the backing Pod goes into Termination state.

Be aware that if you use a variation of `System.exit(0)` after calling SDK.Shutdown(), your game server container may
restart for a brief period, inline with our [Health Checking]({{% ref "/docs/Guides/health-checking.md#health-failure-strategy" %}}) policies. 

If the SDK server receives a TERM signal before calling SDK.Shutdown(),
the SDK server will stay alive for the period of the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` until `SDK.Shutdown()` has been called.

### Configuration Retrieval 

#### GameServer()

This returns most of the backing GameServer configuration and Status. This can be useful
for instances where you may want to know Health check configuration, or the IP and Port
the GameServer is currently allocated to.

Since the GameServer contains an entire [PodTemplate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/#pod-templates)
the returned object is limited to that configuration that was deemed useful. If there are
areas that you feel are missing, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/issues) or pull request.

The easiest way to see what is exposed, is to check
the {{% ghlink href="proto/sdk/sdk.proto" %}}`sdk.proto`{{% /ghlink %}}, specifically at
the `message GameServer`.

For language specific documentation, have a look at the respective source (linked above), 
and the {{< ghlink href="examples" >}}examples{{< /ghlink >}}.

#### WatchGameServer(function(gameserver){...})

This executes the passed in callback with the current `GameServer` details whenever the underlying `GameServer` configuration is updated.
This can be useful to track `GameServer > Status > State` changes, `metadata` changes, such as labels and annotations, and more.

In combination with this SDK, manipulating [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) and
[Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) can also be a useful way to communicate information through to running game server processes from outside those processes.
This is especially useful when combined with `GameServerAllocation` [applied metadata]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" >}}).

Since the GameServer contains an entire [PodTemplate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/#pod-templates)
the returned object is limited to that configuration that was deemed useful. If there are
areas that you feel are missing, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/issues) or pull request.

The easiest way to see what is exposed, is to check
the {{% ghlink href="proto/sdk/sdk.proto" %}}`sdk.proto`{{% /ghlink %}}, specifically at
the `message GameServer`.

For language specific documentation, have a look at the respective source (linked above), 
and the {{< ghlink href="examples" >}}examples{{< /ghlink >}}.


### Metadata Management

#### SetLabel(key, value)

This will set a [Label](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) value on the backing `GameServer`
record that is stored in Kubernetes. 

To maintain isolation, the `key` value is automatically prefixed with the value **"agones.dev/sdk-"**. This is done for 
two main reasons:
*  The prefix allows the developer to always know if they are accessing or reading a value that could have come, or 
   may be changed by the client SDK. Much like `private` vs `public` scope in a programming language, the Agones 
   SDK only gives you access to write to part of the set of labels and annotations that exist on a GameServer.
*  The prefix allows for a smaller attack surface if the GameServer container gets compromised. Since the 
   game container is generally externally exposed, and the Agones project doesn't control the binary that is 
   run within it, limiting exposure if the game server becomes compromised is worth the extra 
   development friction that comes with having this prefix in place.

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning">}}
There are limits on the characters that be used for label keys and values. Details are [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set).

You will need to take them into account when combined with the label prefix above. 
{{< /alert >}}

Setting `GameServer` labels can be useful if you want information from your running game server process to be 
observable or searchable through the Kubernetes API.  

#### SetAnnotation(key, value)

This will set an [Annotation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) value 
on the backing `GameServer` record that is stored in Kubernetes. 

To maintain isolation, the `key` value is automatically prefixed with **"agones.dev/sdk-"** for the same reasons as 
in [SetLabel(...)](#setlabelkey-value) above. The isolation is also important as Agones uses annotations on the 
`GameServer` as part of its internal processing.

Setting `GameServer` annotations can be useful if you want information from your running game server process to be 
observable through the Kubernetes API.

### Counters And Lists

{{< alpha title="Counters And Lists" gate="CountersAndLists" >}}

The `Counters` and `Lists` features in the SDK offer a flexible configuration for tracking various entities like 
players, rooms, and sessions.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
The SDK batches mutation operations every 1 second for performance reasons. However, changes made and subsequently 
retrieved through the SDK will be atomically accurate through the SDK, as those values are tracked within the 
SDK Server sidecar process.

However, changes made through Allocation or the Kubernetes API to `GameServer` List and Counter values will be 
eventually consistent when being retrieved through the SDK.

Since the SDK update operations back to the `GameServer.status` values is batched asynchronous, it is worth noting that
any value incremented past a counter or list capacity may be silently truncated to the currently set capacity if 
modified concurrently through the SDK and Allocation/Kubernetes API.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Counters

All functions will return an error if the specified `key` is not predefined in the `GameServer.spec.counters` resource
configuration.

##### Alpha().GetCounterCount(key)

This function retrieves the current count for a counter in the game server.

##### Alpha().SetCounterCount(key, amount)

This function sets the count to a given value. This operation overwrites any previous values and the new value cannot
exceed the Counter's capacity.

##### Alpha().IncrementCounter(key, amount)

This function increments the count of a counter by a given non-negative value amount. The function returns an
error if the Counter is already at capacity (at time of operation), indicating no increment will occur.

##### Alpha().DecrementCounter(key, amount)

This function decreases the count of a counter by a given non-negative amount. It returns an error if the
Counter's count is already at zero.

##### Alpha().SetCounterCapacity(key, amount)

This function sets the maximum capacity for a counter. A capacity value of 0 indicates no capacity limit.

##### Alpha().GetCounterCapacity(key)

This function retrieves the maximum capacity of a counter.

#### Lists

All functions will return an error if the specified `key` is not predefined in the `GameServer.spec.lists` resource
configuration.

##### Alpha().AppendListValue(key, value)

This function appends the specified string value to a List's values.

An error is returned if the string already exists in the list or if the list is at capacity.

##### Alpha().DeleteListValue(key, value)

This function removes the specific string value string from a List's values. 

An error is returned if the string does not exist in the list.

##### Alpha().SetListCapacity(key, amount)

This function sets the capacity for a specified List with the capacity value required to be
between 0 and 1000.

##### Alpha().GetListCapacity(key)

This function retrieves the capacity of a specified list.

##### Alpha().ListContains(key, value)

This function returns a boolean value on if a specific string value exists in a list's values. 

##### Alpha().GetListLength(key)

This function retrieves the number of items (length) in a  specified List.

##### Alpha().GetListValues(key)

This function returns an array of all the string values from a specified list.

### Player Tracking

{{< alpha title="Player Tracking" gate="PlayerTracking" >}}

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning">}}
[Counters and Lists](#counters-and-lists) will eventually replace the Alpha functionality of Player Tracking, which will subsequently be
removed from Agones. If you are currently using this Alpha feature, we would love for you to test (and ideally migrate
to!) this new functionality to ensure it will meet all your needs.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().PlayerConnect(playerID)

This function increases the SDKâ€™s stored player count by one, and appends this playerID to
`GameServer.Status.Players.IDs`.

[`GameServer.Status.Players.Count` and `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs`][playerstatus]
are then set to update the player count and id list a second from now,
unless there is already an update pending, in which case the update joins that batch operation.

`PlayerConnect()` returns true and adds the playerID to the list of playerIDs if this playerID was not already in the
list of connected playerIDs.

If the playerID exists within the list of connected playerIDs, `PlayerConnect()` will return false, and the list of
connected playerIDs will be left unchanged.

An error will be returned if the playerID was not already in the list of connected playerIDs but the player capacity for
the server has been reached. The playerID will not be added to the list of playerIDs.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
Do not use this method if you are manually managing `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` and `GameServer.Status.Players.Count`
through the Kubernetes API, as indeterminate results will occur.  
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().PlayerDisconnect(playerID)

This function decreases the SDKâ€™s stored player count by one, and removes the playerID from
[`GameServer.Status.Players.IDs`][playerstatus].

`GameServer.Status.Players.Count` and `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` are then set to
update the player count and id list a second from now,
unless there is already an update pending, in which case the update joins that batch operation.

`PlayerDisconnect()` will return true and remove the supplied playerID from the list of connected playerIDs if the
playerID value exists within the list.

If the playerID was not in the list of connected playerIDs, the call will return false, and the connected playerID list
will be left unchanged.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
Do not use this method if you are manually managing `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` and `GameServer.Status.Players.Count`
through the Kubernetes API, as indeterminate results will occur.  
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().SetPlayerCapacity(count)

Update the [`GameServer.Status.Players.Capacity`][playerstatus] value with a new capacity.

#### Alpha().GetPlayerCapacity()

This function retrieves the current player capacity. This is always accurate from what has been set through this SDK,
even if the value has yet to be updated on the GameServer status resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.Capacity` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use `SDK.GameServer()` or
`SDK.WatchGameServer()` instead to view this value.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().GetPlayerCount()

This function retrieves the current player count.
This is always accurate from what has been set through this SDK, even if the value has yet to be updated on the
GameServer status resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use SDK.GameServer()
or SDK.WatchGameServer() instead to retrieve the current player count.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().IsPlayerConnected(playerID)

This function returns if the playerID is currently connected to the GameServer. This is always accurate from what has
been set through this SDK,
even if the value has yet to be updated on the GameServer status resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use SDK.GameServer()
or SDK.WatchGameServer() instead to determine connected status.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().GetConnectedPlayers()

This function returns the list of the currently connected player ids. This is always accurate from what has been set
through this SDK, even if the value has yet to be updated on the GameServer status resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use SDK.GameServer()
or SDK.WatchGameServer() instead to list the connected players.
{{< /alert >}}

## Writing your own SDK

If there isn't an SDK for the language and platform you are looking for, you have several options:

### gRPC Client Generation

If client generation is well supported by [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/), then generate client(s) from
the proto files found in the {{% ghlink href="proto/sdk" %}}`proto/sdk`{{% /ghlink %}},
directory and look at the current {{< ghlink href="sdks" >}}sdks{{< /ghlink >}} to see how the wrappers are
implemented to make interaction with the SDK server simpler for the user.

### REST API Implementation

If client generation is not well supported by gRPC, or if there are other complicating factors, implement the SDK through
the [REST]({{< relref "rest.md" >}}) HTTP+JSON interface. This could be written by hand, or potentially generated from
the {{< ghlink href="sdks/swagger" >}}Swagger/OpenAPI Specifications{{< /ghlink >}}.

Finally, if you build something that would be usable by the community, please submit a pull request!

## SDK Conformance Test

There is a tool `SDK server Conformance` checker which will run Local SDK server and record all requests your client is performing.

In order to check that SDK is working properly you should write simple SDK test client which would use all methods of your SDK.

Also to test that SDK client is receiving valid Gameserver data, your binary should set the same `Label` value as creation timestamp which you will receive as a result of GameServer() call and `Annotation` value same as gameserver UID received by Watch gameserver callback.

Complete list of endpoints which should be called by your test client is the following:
```
ready,allocate,setlabel,setannotation,gameserver,health,shutdown,watch
```

In order to run this test SDK server locally use:
```
SECONDS=30 make run-sdk-conformance-local
```

Docker container would timeout in 30 seconds and give your the comparison of received requests and expected requests

For instance you could run Go SDK conformance test and see how the process goes: 
```
SDK_FOLDER=go make run-sdk-conformance-test
```

In order to add test client for your SDK, write `sdktest.sh` and `Dockerfile`. Refer to {{< ghlink href="build/build-sdk-images/go" >}}Golang SDK Conformance testing directory structure{{< /ghlink >}}.

## Building the Tools

If you wish to build the binaries from source
the `make` target `build-agones-sdk-binary` will compile the necessary binaries
for all supported operating systems (64 bit windows, linux and osx).

You can find the binaries in the `bin` folder in {{< ghlink href="cmd/sdk-server" >}}`cmd/sdk-server`{{< /ghlink >}}
once compilation is complete.

See {{< ghlink href="build" branch="main" >}}Developing, Testing and Building Agones{{< /ghlink >}} for more details.
