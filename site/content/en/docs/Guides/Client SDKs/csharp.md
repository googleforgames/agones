## Download

Download the source {{< ghlink href="sdks/csharp" >}}directly from GitHub{{< /ghlink >}}.

## Install using NuGet

- Download the nuget package [directly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AgonesSDK/)
- Install the latest version using the Package Manager: `Install-Package AgonesSDK`
- Install the latest version using the .NET CLI: `dotnet add package AgonesSDK`

To select a specific version, append `--version`, for example: `--version 1.8.0` to either commands.

## Prerequisites

- .Net Standard 2.0 compliant framework.

## Usage

Reference the SDK in your project & create a new instance of the SDK wrapper:

### Initialization

To use the AgonesSDK, you will need to import the namespace by adding `using Agones;` at the beginning of your relevant files.

```csharp
var agones = new AgonesSDK();
```

### Ready

To mark the game server as [ready to receive player connections]({{< relref "_index.md#ready" >}}), call the async method `ReadyAsync()`.

```csharp
async void SomeMethod()
{
    var status = await agones.ReadyAsync();
}
```

### Health

To send `Health` pings, call the async method `HealthAsync()`
```csharp
await agones.HealthAsync();
```

### GetGameServer

To get the details on the [backing `GameServer`]({{< relref "_index.md#gameserver" >}}) call `GetGameServerAsync()`.

Will return `null` if there is an error in retrieving the `GameServer` record.

```csharp
var gameserver = await agones.GetGameServerAsync();
```

### Reserve

To mark the GameServer as [Reserved]({{< relref "_index.md#reserveseconds" >}}) for a duration call
`ReserveAsync(long duration)`.

```csharp
long duration = 30;
var status = await agones.ReserveAsync(duration);
```

### ShutDown

To mark that the [game session is completed]({{< relref "_index.md#shutdown" >}}) and the game server should be shut down call `ShutdownAsync()`.

```csharp
var status = await agones.ShutdownAsync();
```

### SetAnnotation &  SetLabel
Similarly `SetAnnotation(string key, string value)` and `SetLabel(string key, string value)` are async methods that perform an action & return a `Status` object.

### WatchGameServer

To watch when
[the backing `GameServer` configuration changes]({{< relref "_index.md#watchgameserverfunctiongameserver" >}})
call `WatchGameServer(callback)`, where the delegate function `callback` of type `Action<GameServer>` will be executed every time the `GameServer`
configuration changes.
This process is non-blocking internally.

```csharp
agonesSDK.WatchGameServer((gameServer) => { Console.WriteLine($"Server - Watch {gameServer}");});
```


### Counters And Lists

{{< beta title="Counters And Lists" gate="CountsAndLists" >}}

#### Counters

##### Beta: GetCounterCount

Returns the Count for a Counter, given the Counter's key (name). Will error if the key was not
predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "rooms";
long count = await agones.Beta().GetCounterCountAsync(key);
```

##### Beta: SetCounterCount

Sets a count to the given value. Use with care, as this will overwrite any previous invocations’ value.
Cannot be greater than Capacity.

```csharp
string key = "rooms";
long amount = 0;
await agones.Beta().SetCounterCountAsync(key, amount);
```

##### Beta: IncrementCounter

Increases a counter by the given nonnegative integer amount. Will execute the increment operation
against the current CRD value. Will max at max(int64). Will error if the key was not predefined in
the GameServer resource on creation. Errors if the count is at the current capacity (to the latest
knowledge of the SDK), and no increment will occur.

Note: A potential race condition here is that if count values are set from both the SDK and through
the K8s API (Allocation or otherwise), since the SDK append operation back to the CRD value is
batched asynchronous any value incremented past the capacity will be silently truncated.

```csharp
string key = "rooms";
long amount = 1;
await agones.Beta().IncrementCounterAsync(key, amount);
```

##### Beta: DecrementCounter

Decreases the current count by the given nonnegative integer amount. The Counter Will not go below 0.
Will execute the decrement operation against the current CRD value. Errors if the count is at 0 (to
the latest knowledge of the SDK), and no decrement will occur.

```csharp
string key = "rooms";
long amount = 2;
await agones.Beta().DecrementCounterAsync(key, amount);
```

##### Beta: SetCounterCapacity

Sets the capacity for the given Counter. A capacity of 0 is no capacity.

```csharp
string key = "rooms";
long amount = 0;
await agones.Beta().SetCounterCapacityAsync(key, amount);
```

##### Beta: GetCounterCapacity

Returns the Capacity for a Counter, given the Counter's key (name). Will error if the key was not
predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "rooms";
long count = await agones.Beta().GetCounterCapacityAsync(key);
```
#### Lists

##### Beta: AppendListValue

Appends a string to a List's values list, given the List's key (name) and the string value. Will
error if the string already exists in the list. Will error if the key was not predefined in the
GameServer resource on creation. Will error if the list is already at capacity.

```csharp
string key = "players";
string value = "player1";
await agones.Beta().AppendListValueAsync(key, value);
```

##### Beta: DeleteListValue

DeleteListValue removes a string from a List's values list, given the List's key (name) and the
string value. Will error if the string does not exist in the list. Will error if the key was not
predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "players";
string value = "player2";
await agones.Beta().DeleteListValueAsync(key, value);
```

##### Beta: SetListCapacity

Sets the capacity for a given list. Capacity must be between 0 and 1000. Will error if the key was
not predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "players";
long amount = 1000;
await agones.Beta().SetListCapacityAsync(key, amount);
```

##### Beta: GetListCapacity

Returns the Capacity for a List, given the List's key (name). Will error if the key was not
predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "players";
long amount = await agones.Beta().GetListCapacityAsync(key);
```

##### Beta: ListContains

Returns if a string exists in a List's values list, given the List's key (name) and the string value.
Search is case-sensitive. Will error if the key was not predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "players";
string value = "player3";
bool contains = await agones.Beta().ListContainsAsync(key, value);
```

##### Beta: GetListLength

GetListLength returns the length of the Values list for a List, given the List's key (name). Will
error if the key was not predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "players";
int listLength = await agones.Beta().GetListLengthAsync(key);
```

##### Beta: GetListValues

Returns the <IList<string>> Values for a List, given the List's key (name). Will error if the key
was not predefined in the GameServer resource on creation.

```csharp
string key = "players";
List<string> values = await agones.Beta().GetListValuesAsync(key);
```

### Player Tracking

{{< alpha title="Player Tracking" gate="PlayerTracking" >}}

#### Alpha: PlayerConnect

This method increases the SDK’s stored player count by one, and appends this playerID to GameServer.Status.Players.IDs.
Returns true and adds the playerID to the list of playerIDs if the playerIDs was not already in the list of connected playerIDs.

```csharp
bool ok = await agones.Alpha().PlayerConnectAsync(playerId);
```

#### Alpha: PlayerDisconnect

This function decreases the SDK’s stored player count by one, and removes the playerID from GameServer.Status.Players.IDs.
Will return true and remove the supplied playerID from the list of connected playerIDs if the playerID value exists within the list.

```csharp
bool ok = await agones.Alpha().PlayerDisconnectAsync(playerId);
```

#### Alpha: SetPlayerCapacity

Update the `GameServer.Status.Players.Capacity` value with a new capacity.

```csharp
var capacity = 100;
var status = await agones.Alpha().SetPlayerCapacityAsync(capacity);
```

#### Alpha: GetPlayerCapacity

This function retrieves the current player capacity `GameServer.Status.Players.Capacity`.
This is always accurate from what has been set through this SDK, even if the value has yet to be updated on the GameServer status resource.

```csharp
long cap = await agones.Alpha().GetPlayerCapacityAsync();
```

#### Alpha: GetPlayerCount

Returns the current player count

```csharp
long count = await agones.Alpha().GetPlayerCountAsync();
```

#### Alpha: IsPlayerConnected

This returns if the playerID is currently connected to the GameServer.
This is always accurate, even if the value hasn’t been updated to the GameServer status yet.

```csharp
var playerId = "player1";
bool isConnected = await agones.Alpha().IsPlayerConnectedAsync(playerId);
```

## Remarks
- All requests will wait for up to 15 seconds before giving up. Time to wait can also be set in the constructor.
- Default host & port are `localhost:9357`
- Methods that do not return a data object such as `GameServer` will return a gRPC `Grpc.Core.Status` object. To check the state of the request, check `Status.StatusCode` & `Status.Detail`.
Ex:
```csharp
if(status.StatusCode == StatusCode.OK)
    //do stuff
```
