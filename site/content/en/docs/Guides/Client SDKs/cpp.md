or {{< ghlink href="sdks/cpp" >}}directly from GitHub{{< /ghlink >}}.

## Usage

The C++ SDK is specifically designed to be as simple as possible, and deliberately doesn't include any kind
of singleton management, or threading/asynchronous processing to allow developers to manage these aspects as they deem
appropriate for their system.

We may consider these types of features in the future, depending on demand.

To begin working with the SDK, create an instance of it:
```cpp
agones::SDK *sdk = new agones::SDK();
```

To connect to the SDK server, either local or when running on Agones, run the `sdk->Connect()` method.
This will block for up to 30 seconds if the SDK server has not yet started and the connection cannot be made,
and will return `false` if there was an issue connecting.

```cpp
bool ok = sdk->Connect();
```

To send a [health check]({{< relref "_index.md#health" >}}) call `sdk->Health()`. This is a synchronous request that will
return `false` if it has failed in any way. Read [GameServer Health Checking]({{< relref "../health-checking.md" >}}) for more
details on the game server health checking strategy.

```cpp
bool ok = sdk->Health();
```

To mark the game server as [ready to receive player connections]({{< relref "_index.md#ready" >}}), call `sdk->Ready()`.
This will return a grpc::Status object, from which we can call `status.ok()` to determine
if the function completed successfully.

For more information you can also look at the [gRPC Status reference](https://grpc.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_status.html).

```cpp
grpc::Status status = sdk->Ready();
if (!status.ok()) { ... }
```

To mark the game server as [allocated]({{< relref "_index.md#allocate" >}}), call `sdk->Allocate()`.
This will return a grpc::Status object, from which we can call `status.ok()` to determine
if the function completed successfully.

For more information you can also look at the [gRPC Status reference](https://grpc.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_status.html).

```cpp
grpc::Status status = sdk->Allocate();
if (!status.ok()) { ... }
```

To mark the game server as [reserved]({{< relref "_index.md#reserveseconds" >}}), call
`sdk->Reserve(seconds)`. This will return a grpc::Status object, from which we can call `status.ok()` to determine
if the function completed successfully.

For more information you can also look at the [gRPC Status reference](https://grpc.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_status.html).

```cpp
grpc::Status status = sdk->Reserve(std::chrono::seconds(N));
if (!status.ok()) { ... }
```

To mark that the [game session is completed]({{< relref "_index.md#shutdown" >}}) and the game server should be shut down call `sdk->Shutdown()`.
This will return a grpc::Status object, from which we can call `status.ok()` to determine
if the function completed successfully.

For more information you can also look at the [gRPC Status reference](https://grpc.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_status.html).

```cpp
grpc::Status status = sdk->Shutdown();
if (!status.ok()) { ... }
```

To [set a Label]({{< relref "_index.md#setlabelkey-value" >}}) on the backing `GameServer` call
`sdk->SetLabel(key, value)`.
This will return a grpc::Status object, from which we can call `status.ok()` to determine
if the function completed successfully.

For more information you can also look at the [gRPC Status reference](https://grpc.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_status.html).

```cpp
grpc::Status status = sdk->SetLabel("test-label", "test-value");
if (!status.ok()) { ... }
```

To [set an Annotation]({{< relref "_index.md#setannotationkey-value" >}}) on the backing `GameServer` call
`sdk->SetAnnotation(key, value)`.
This will return a grpc::Status object, from which we can call `status.ok()` to determine
if the function completed successfully.

For more information you can also look at the [gRPC Status reference](https://grpc.io/grpc/cpp/classgrpc_1_1_status.html).

```cpp
status = sdk->SetAnnotation("test-annotation", "test value");
if (!status.ok()) { ... }
```

To get the details on the [backing `GameServer`]({{< relref "_index.md#gameserver" >}}) call `sdk->GameServer(&gameserver)`,
passing in a `agones::dev::sdk::GameServer*` to push the results of the `GameServer` configuration into.

This function will return a grpc::Status object, from which we can call `status.ok()` to determine
if the function completed successfully.

```cpp
agones::dev::sdk::GameServer gameserver;
grpc::Status status = sdk->GameServer(&gameserver);
if (!status.ok()) {...}
```

To get [updates on the backing `GameServer`]({{< relref "_index.md#watchgameserverfunctiongameserver" >}}) as they happen,
call `sdk->WatchGameServer([](const agones::dev::sdk::GameServer& gameserver){...})`.

This will call the passed in `std::function`
synchronously (this is a blocking function, so you may want to run it in its own thread) whenever the backing `GameServer`
is updated.

```cpp
sdk->WatchGameServer([](const agones::dev::sdk::GameServer& gameserver){
  std::cout << "GameServer Update:\n"                                 //
            << "\tname: " << gameserver.object_meta().name() << "\n"  //
            << "\tstate: " << gameserver.status().state() << "\n"
            << std::flush;
});
```

### Failure
When running on Agones, the above functions should only fail under exceptional circumstances, so please
file a bug if it occurs.

### Building the Libraries from source
CMake is used to build SDK for all supported platforms (Linux/Window/MacOS).

## Prerequisites
* CMake >= 3.13.0
* Git
* C++14 compiler

Agones SDK depends on [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/BUILDING.md). If CMake cannot find gRPC with find_package(), it downloads and builds gRPC.
There are some extra prerequisites for OpenSSL on Windows, see [documentation](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/NOTES.WIN):

* Perl
* NASM

Note that OpenSSL is not used in Agones SDK, but it is required to have full successfull build of gRPC.

## Options
Following options are available:

- **AGONES_THIRDPARTY_INSTALL_PATH** (default is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) - installation path for Agones prerequisites (used only if gRPC and Protobuf are not found by find_package)
- **AGONES_ZLIB_STATIC** (default is ON) - use static version of zlib for gRPC

(Windows only):

- **AGONES_BUILD_THIRDPARTY_DEBUG** (default is OFF) - build both debug and release versions of SDK's prerequisites. Option is not used if you already have built gRPC.
- **AGONES_OPENSSL_CONFIG_STRING** (default is VC-WIN64A) - arguments to configure OpenSSL build ([documentation](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/INSTALL)). Used only if OpenSSL and gRPC is built by Agones.

## Linux / MacOS
```bash
mkdir -p .build
cd .build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install
cmake --build . --target install
```

## Windows
Building with Visual Studio:
```bash
md .build
cd .build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```
Building with NMake
```bash
md .build
cd .build
cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install
cmake --build . --target install
```

## Remarks
**CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX** may be skipped if it is OK to install Agones SDK to a default location (usually /usr/local or c:/Program Files/Agones).

CMake option `-Wno-dev` is specified to suppress [CMP0048](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.13/policy/CMP0048.html) deprecation warning for gRPC build.

If **AGONES_ZLIB_STATIC** is set to OFF, ensure that you have installed zlib. For Windows it's enough to copy zlib.dll near to gameserver executable. For Linux/Mac usually no actions are needed.

### Using SDK
In CMake-based projects it's enough to specify a folder where SDK is installed with `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and use `find_package(agones CONFIG REQUIRED)` command. For example: {{< ghlink href="examples/cpp-simple" >}}cpp-simple{{< / >}}.
It may be useful to disable some [protobuf warnings](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/cmake/README.md#notes-on-compiler-warnings) in your project.
