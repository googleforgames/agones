  Game servers running on Agones may be disrupted by Kubernetes; learn how to control disruption of your game servers.

## Disruption in Kubernetes

[A `Pod` in Kubernetes may be disrupted](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/#voluntary-and-involuntary-disruptions) for involuntary reasons, e.g. hardware failure, or voluntary reasons, such as when nodes are drained for upgrades. 

By default, Agones assumes your game server should never be disrupted voluntarily and configures the `Pod` appropriately - but this isn't always the ideal setting. Here we discuss how Agones allows you to control the two most significant sources of voluntary `Pod` evictions, node upgrades and Cluster Autoscaler, using the `eviction` API on the `GameServer` object. 

## Benefits of Allowing Voluntary Disruption

It's not always easy to write your game server in a way that allows for disruption, but it can have major benefits:

* Compaction of your cluster using [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) can lead to considerable cost savings for your infrastructure.
* Allowing automated node upgrades can save you management toil, and lowers the time it takes to patch security vulnerabilites.

## Considerations

When discussing game server pod disruption, it's important to keep two factors in mind:

* **`TERM` signal:** Is your game server tolerant of graceful termination? If you wish to support voluntary disruption, your game server must handle the `TERM` signal (even if it runs to completion after receiving `TERM`).
* **Termination Grace Period:** After receiving `TERM`, how long does your game server need to run? If you run to completion after receiving `TERM`, this is equivalent to the session length - if not, you can think of this as the cleanup time. In general, we bucket the grace period into "less than 10 minutes", "10 minutes to an hour", and "greater than an hour". (See [below](#whats-special-about-ten-minutes-and-one-hour) if you are curious about grace period considerations.)

## `eviction` API

The `eviction` API is specified as part of the `GameServerSpec`, like:

```yaml
apiVersion: "agones.dev/v1"
kind: GameServer
metadata:
  name: "simple-game-server"
spec:
  eviction:
    safe: Always
  template:
    [...]
```

You can set `eviction.safe` based on your game server's tolerance for disruption and session length, based on the following diagram:

![Eviction Decision Diagram](../../../diagrams/eviction-decision.dot.png)

In words:

* Does the game server support `TERM` and terminate within ten minutes?
  * Yes to both: Set `safe: Always`, and set [terminationGracePeriodSeconds](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#hook-handler-execution) to the session length or cleanup time.
  * No to either: Does the game server support `TERM` and terminate within an hour?
      * Yes to both: Set `safe: OnUpgrade`, and configure [terminationGracePeriodSeconds](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#hook-handler-execution) to the session length or cleanup time.
      * No to either: Set `safe: Never`. If your game server does not terminate within an hour, see [below](#considerations-for-long-sessions).

{{< alert title="Note" color="info" >}}
To maintain backward compatibility with Agones prior to the introduction of `eviction` API, if your game server previously configured the `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: true` annotation, we assume `eviction.safe: Always` is intended.

GKE Autopilot supports only `Never` and `Always`, not `OnUpgrade`.

## What's special about ten minutes and one hour?

* **Ten minutes:** Cluster Autoscaler respects [ten minutes of graceful termination](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#does-ca-respect-gracefultermination-in-scale-down) on scale-down. On some cloud products, you can configure `--max-graceful-termination-sec` to change this, but it is not advised: Cluster Autoscaler is currently only capable of scaling down one node at a time, and larger graceful termination windows slow this down farther (see [autoscaler#5079](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/5079)). If the ten minute limit does not apply to you, generally you should choose between `safe: Always` (for sessions less than an hour), or see [below](#considerations-for-long-sessions).

* **One hour:** On many cloud products, `PodDisruptionBudget` can only block node upgrade evictions for a certain period of time - on GKE this is 1h. After that, the PDB is ignored, or the node upgrade fails with an error. Controlling `Pod` disruption for longer than one hour requires cluster configuration changes outside of Agones - see [below](#considerations-for-long-sessions).

## Considerations for long sessions

Outside of Cluster Autoscaler, the main source of disruption for long sessions is node upgrade. On some cloud products, such as GKE Standard, node upgrades are entirely within your control. On others, such as GKE Autopilot, node upgrade is automatic. Typical node upgrades use an eviction based, rolling recreate strategy, and may not honor `PodDisruptionBudget` for longer than an hour. See [Best Practices]({{< relref "Best Practices" >}}) for information specific to your cloud product.

## Implementation / Under the hood

Each option uses a slightly different permutation of:
* the `safe-to-evict` annotation to block [Cluster Autoscaler based eviction](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node), and
* the `agones.dev/safe-to-evict` label selector to select the `agones-gameserver-safe-to-evict-false` `PodDisruptionBudget`. This blocks [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node) and (for a limited time) [disruption from node upgrades](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/#pod-disruption-budgets).
  * Note that PDBs do influence pod preemption as well, but it's not guaranteed.

As a quick reference:

| evictions.safe setting  |  `safe-to-evict` pod annotation |  `agones.dev/safe-to-evict` label |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `Never` (default)       | `false`                         | `false` (matches PDB)             |
| `OnUpgrade`             | `false`                         | `true` (does not match PDB)       |
| `Always`                | `true`                          | `true` (does not match PDB)       |
