---

To allocate a `GameServer` from a `Fleet`, use a `GameServerAllocation`.

Like any other Kubernetes resource you describe a `Fleet`'s desired state via a specification written in YAML or JSON to the Kubernetes API. The Agones controller will then change the actual state to the desired state.

A full `Fleet` specification is available below and in the {{< ghlink href="examples/fleet.yaml" >}}example folder{{< /ghlink >}} for reference :

Since Agones defines a new 
[Custom Resources Definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/) 
we can define a new resource using the kind `Fleet` with the custom group `agones.dev` and API 
version `v1`.

You can use the metadata field to target a specific 
[namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) but also 
attach specific [annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) 
and [labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) to your resource. 
This is a very common pattern in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

The length of the `name` field of the fleet should be at most 63 characters.

The `spec` field is the actual `Fleet` specification and it is composed as follow:

- `replicas` is the number of `GameServers` to keep Ready or Allocated in this Fleet
- `scheduling` defines how GameServers are organised across the cluster. Affects backing Pod scheduling, as well as scale
                 down mechanics.
                 "Packed" (default) is aimed at dynamic Kubernetes clusters, such as cloud providers, wherein we want to bin pack
                 resources. "Distributed" is aimed at static Kubernetes clusters, wherein we want to distribute resources across the entire
                 cluster. See [Scheduling and Autoscaling]({{< relref "../Advanced/scheduling-and-autoscaling.md" >}}) for more details.
- `strategy` is the `GameServer` replacement strategy for when the `GameServer` template is edited.
  - `type` is replacement strategy for when the GameServer template is changed. Default option is "RollingUpdate", but "Recreate" is also available.
    - `RollingUpdate` will increment by `maxSurge` value on each iteration, while decrementing by `maxUnavailable` on each iteration, until all GameServers have been switched from one version to another.   
    - `Recreate` terminates all non-allocated `GameServers`, and starts up a new set with the new `GameServer` configuration to replace them.
  - `rollingUpdate` is only relevant when `type: RollingUpdate`
    - `maxSurge` is the amount to increment the new GameServers by. Defaults to 25%
    - `maxUnavailable` is the amount to decrements GameServers by. Defaults to 25%
- `allocationOverflow` (Alpha, requires `FleetAllocationOverflow` flag) The labels and/or Annotations to apply to 
  GameServers when the number of Allocated GameServers exceeds the desired replicas in the underlying 
  `GameServerSet`.
  - `labels` the map of labels to be applied
  - `annotations` the map of annotations to be applied
  - `Fleet's Scheduling Strategy`: The GameServers associated with the GameServerSet are sorted based on either `Packed` or `Distributed` strategy.
      - `Packed`: Agones maximizes resource utilization by trying to populate nodes that are already in use before allocating GameServers to other nodes.
      - `Distributed`: Agones employs this strategy to spread out GameServer allocations, ensuring an even distribution of GameServers across the available nodes.
- `template` a full `GameServer` configuration template.
   See the [GameServer]({{< relref "gameserver.md" >}}) reference for all available fields.

## Fleet Scale Subresource Specification

Scale subresource is defined for a Fleet. Please refer to [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#subresources).

You can use the following command to scale the fleet with name simple-game-server:

```bash
kubectl scale fleet simple-game-server --replicas=10
```
```
fleet.agones.dev/simple-game-server scaled
```

You can also use [Kubernetes API]({{< ref "/docs/Guides/access-api.md" >}}) to get or update the Replicas count:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/apis/agones.dev/v1/namespaces/default/fleets/simple-game-server/scale
```
```
{
  "kind": "Scale",
  "apiVersion": "autoscaling/v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "simple-game-server",
    "namespace": "default",
    "selfLink": "/apis/agones.dev/v1/namespaces/default/fleets/simple-game-server/scale",
    "uid": "4dfaa310-2566-11e9-afd1-42010a8a0058",
    "resourceVersion": "292652",
    "creationTimestamp": "2019-01-31T14:41:33Z"
  },
  "spec": {
    "replicas": 10
  },
  "status": {
    "replicas": 10
  }
```

Also exposing a Scale subresource would allow you to configure HorizontalPodAutoscaler and PodDisruptionBudget for a fleet in the future. However these features have not been tested, and are not currently supported - but if you are looking for these features, please be sure to let us know in the [ticket](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/issues/553).
