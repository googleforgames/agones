The `spec` field is the actual `GameServerAllocation` specification, and it is composed as follows:

- Deprecated, use `selectors` instead. If `selectors` is set, this field will be ignored.
  `required` is a [GameServerSelector][gameserverselector]
  (matchLabels. matchExpressions, gameServerState and player filters) from which to choose GameServers from.
- Deprecated, use `selectors` instead. If `selectors` is set, this field will be ignored.
  `preferred` is an ordered list of preferred [GameServerSelector][gameserverselector]
  that are _optional_ to be fulfilled, but will be searched before the `required` selector.
  If the first selector is not matched, the selection attempts the second selector, and so on.
  If any of the `preferred` selectors are matched, the `required` selector is not considered.
  This is useful for things like smoke testing of new game servers.
- `selectors` is an ordered list of [GameServerSelector][gameserverselector].
  If the first selector is not matched, the selection attempts the second selector, and so on.
  This is useful for things like smoke testing of new game servers.
- `scheduling` defines how GameServers are organised across the cluster, in this case specifically when allocating
  `GameServers` for usage.
  "Packed" (default) is aimed at dynamic Kubernetes clusters, such as cloud providers, wherein we want to bin pack
  resources. "Distributed" is aimed at static Kubernetes clusters, wherein we want to distribute resources across the entire
  cluster. See [Scheduling and Autoscaling]({{< ref "/docs/Advanced/scheduling-and-autoscaling.md" >}}) for more details.
- `metadata` is an optional list of custom labels and/or annotations that will be used to patch
  the game server's metadata in the moment of allocation. This can be used to tell the server necessary session data

Once created the `GameServerAllocation` will have a `status` field consisting of the following:

- `State` is the current state of a GameServerAllocation, e.g. `Allocated`, or `UnAllocated`
- `GameServerName` is the name of the game server attached to this allocation, once the `state` is `Allocated`
- `Ports` is a list of the ports that the game server makes available. See [the GameServer Reference]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserver.md" >}}) for more details.
- `Address` is the primary network address where the game server can be reached.
{{% feature publishVersion="1.34.0" %}}
- `Addresses` is an array of all network addresses where the game server can be reached. It is a copy of the [`Node.Status.addresses`][addresses] field for the node the `GameServer` is scheduled on.
{{% /feature %}}
- `NodeName` is the name of the node that the gameserver is running on.
- `Source` is "local" unless this allocation is from a remote cluster, in which case `Source` is the endpoint of the remote agones-allocator. See [Multi-cluster Allocation]({{< ref "/docs/Advanced/multi-cluster-allocation.md" >}}) for more details.
- `Metadata` conststs of:
  - `Labels` containing the labels of the game server at allocation time.
  - `Annotations` containing the annotations of the underlying game server at allocation time.

For performance reasons, the query cache for a `GameServerAllocation` is _eventually consistent_.

Usually, the cache is populated practically immediately on `GameServer` change, but under high load of the Kubernetes
control plane, it may take some time for updates to `GameServer` selectable features to be populated into the cache
(although this doesn't affect the atomicity of the Allocation operation).

While Agones will do a small series of retries when an allocatable `GameServer` is not available in its cache,
depending on your game requirements, it may be worth implementing your own more extend retry mechanism for
Allocation requests for high load scenarios.

{{< /alert >}}

Each `GameServerAllocation` will allocate from a single [namespace][namespace]. The namespace can be specified outside of
the spec, either with the `--namespace` flag when using the command line / `kubectl` or
[in the url]({{% ref "/docs/Guides/access-api.md#allocate-a-gameserver-from-a-fleet-named-simple-game-server-with-gameserverallocation"  %}})
when using an API call. If not specified when using the command line, the [namespace][namespace] will be automatically set to `default`.
