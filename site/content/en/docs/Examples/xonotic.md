  This Xonotic example shows setting up, deploying, and managing a Xonotic game server on a Kubernetes cluster with Agones. It uses a simple Go wrapper to connect existing game servers with Agones, making it straightforward to run games in the cloud.
---

## Prerequisite

 To get started, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

  - You have a running Kubernetes cluster.

  - Agones is installed on your cluster. Refer to the [Agones guide](https://agones.dev/site/docs/installation/install-agones/) for the instructions.

  - The Xonotic client downloaded for gameplay. Download it from [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org)

  - (Optional) Review {{< ghlink href="examples/xonotic" >}}Xonotic code{{< /ghlink >}} to see the details of this example.


## Create a Fleet

Let's create a Fleet using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleforgames/agones/{{< release-branch >}}/examples/xonotic/fleet.yaml
```

You should see a successful output similar to this :

```
fleet.agones.dev/xonotic created
```

This has created a Fleet record inside Kubernetes, which in turn creates two ready [GameServers]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserver.md" >}})
that are available to be allocated for a game session.

```bash
kubectl get fleet
```
It should look something like this:

```
NAME           SCHEDULING   DESIRED   CURRENT   ALLOCATED   READY   AGE
xonotic        Packed       2         2         0           2       55s
```

You can also see the GameServers that have been created by the Fleet by running `kubectl get gameservers`,
the GameServer will be prefixed by `xonotic`.

```
NAME                       STATE   ADDRESS          PORT   NODE                                        AGE
xonotic-7lk8x-hgfrg        Ready   34.71.168.92     7206   gk3-genai-quickstart-pool-3-ba2a705f-wpmc   103s
xonotic-7lk8x-rwhst        Ready   34.71.168.92     7330   gk3-genai-quickstart-pool-3-ba2a705f-wpmc   103s
```

For the full details of the YAML file head to the [Fleet Specification Guide]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/fleet.md" >}})


## Connect to the Game Server

After allocating a GameServer from the fleet and obtaining its status and IP, you're ready to connect and play. Hereâ€™s how to use the server IP and port to join the game with the Xonotic server:

**Launch Xonotic**: Start the Xonotic client you previously downloaded by running the executable for your operating system ([documentation](https://xonotic.org/faq/#install)).

**Multiplayer Mode**: From the main menu, select "Multiplayer".

**Server Connection**: Choose to join a server manually and input the IP and port number you obtained from the `kubectl get gameservers` command.

**Join the Game**: After entering the server details, proceed to join the server. You should now be connected to your Agones-managed Xonotic game server and ready to play.

## Cleaning Up

After you're done playing, it's a good idea to clean up. To remove the Agones fleet you deployed, execute the following command. This will remove the fleet along with all the game server instances it manages:

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleforgames/agones/{{< release-branch >}}/examples/xonotic/fleet.yaml
```
