## Integrations with other projects

* [Octops/Agones x Open Match](https://github.com/Octops/agones-discover-openmatch) - How to implement a matchmaking 
  system using Agones and Open Match

## Minetest

* [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) is a free and open-source sandbox video game available for Linux, FreeBSD, 
Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Android. Minetest game play is very similar to that of Minecraft. Players explore a blocky 3D world, discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures and landscapes. 
* [Minetest server for Agones](https://github.com/paulhkim80/agones-example-minetest) is an example of the Minetest 
  server hosted on Kubernetes using Agones. It wraps the Minetest server with a [Go](https://golang.org) binary, and introspects stdout to provide the event hooks for the SDK integration. The wrapper is from [Xonotic Example](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/examples/xonotic/main.go) with a few changes to look for the Minetest ready output message.  

You will need to download the Minetest client separately to play.
