  Follow these steps to create a [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) cluster
  for your Agones install.
---

## Installing Minikube

First, [install Minikube][minikube], which may also require you to install
a virtualisation solution, such as [VirtualBox][vb] as well.

[minikube]: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
[vb]: https://www.virtualbox.org

## Starting Minikube

Minikube will need to be started with the supported version of Kubernetes that is supported with Agones, via the
`--kubernetes-version` command line flag.

Optionally, we also recommend starting with an `agones` profile, using `-p` to keep this cluster separate from any other
clusters you may have running with Minikube.

```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version v{{% minikube-example-cluster-version %}} -p agones
```

Check the official [minikube start](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/start/) reference for more options that
may be required for your platform of choice.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
You may need to increase the `--cpu` or `--memory` values for your minikube instance, depending on what resources are
available on the host and/or how many GameServers you wish to run locally.

Depending on your Operating System, you may also need to change the `--driver`
([driver list](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)) to enable `GameServer` connectivity with or without
some workarounds listed below. 
{{< /alert >}}

### Known working drivers

Other operating systems and drivers may work, but at this stage have not been verified to work with UDP connections
via Agones exposed ports.

**Linux (amd64)**
* Docker (default)
* kvm2

**Mac (amd64)**
* Docker (default)
* Hyperkit

**Windows (amd64 - Windows 10 Enterprise or Pro)**
* Hyper-V: You might need to refer to [this blog post](https://blog.thepolyglotprogrammer.com/setting-up-kubernetes-on-wsl-to-work-with-minikube-on-windows-10-90dac3c72fa1) and/or [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4288#issuecomment-652259640) for WSL support.

**Windows (amd64)**
* Docker (default) with [this workaround](#minikube-start---ports-docker-only)
* VirtualBox: You might need [this command](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/3900) to disable hardware virtualization checks before starting the VM.

## Local connection workarounds

Depending on your operating system and virtualization platform that you are using with Minikube, it may not be
possible to connect directly to a `GameServer` hosted on Agones as you would on a cloud hosted Kubernetes cluster.

If you are unable to do so, the following workarounds are available, and may work on your platform:

### minikube ip

Rather than using the published IP of a `GameServer` to connect, run `minikube ip -p agones` to get the local IP for
the minikube node, and connect to that address.

### minikube start \-\-ports (Docker only)

Since you cannot connect to minikube's private IP on Windows, a more reliable option is to publish the `GameServer`'s port range
directly through Docker by making use of Minikube's `--ports` option. Unfortunately, exposing Agones' entire default port range
(7000-8000) may cause Minikube to crash upon startup, so you will likely need to set a narrower port range as shown below.

This method requires a fresh Minikube cluster, so you may need to run `minikube delete -p agones` before continuing.

```bash
minikube start --kubernetes-version v{{% minikube-example-cluster-version %}} -p agones --ports 7000-7100:7000-7100/udp
```

When installing Agones on the new cluster (using [Helm]({{< relref "../Install Agones/helm.md" >}})), update the port range accordingly:

```bash
helm install my-release --namespace agones-system --create-namespace \
  --set gameservers.minPort=7000,gameservers.maxPort=7100 agones/agones
```

Once you have a `GameServer` running, try connecting to its port either on 127.0.0.1 or WSL's IP (`wsl hostname -I`).

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
The port range 7000-7100 will likely allow Minikube to start consistently, but you can narrow or widen this range
to whatever works on your system. Make sure it is consistent between both the `minikube start` command shown above and
the Helm configuration.
{{< /alert >}}

### Create a service

This would only be for local development, but if none of the other workarounds work, creating a Service for the
`GameServer` you wish to connect to is a valid solution, to tunnel traffic to the appropriate GameServer container.

Use the following yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: agones-gameserver
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    agones.dev/gameserver: ${GAMESERVER_NAME}
  ports:
  - protocol: UDP
    port: 7000 # local port
    targetPort: ${GAMESERVER_CONTAINER_PORT}
```

Where `${GAMESERVER_NAME}` is replaced with the GameServer you wish to connect to, and `${GAMESERVER_CONTAINER_PORT}`
is replaced with the container port GameServer exposes for connection.

Running `minikube service list -p agones` will show you the IP and port to connect to locally in the `URL` field.

To connect to a different `GameServer`, run `kubectl edit service agones-gameserver` and edit the `${GAMESERVER_NAME}`
value to point to the new `GameServer` instance and/or the `${GAMESERVER_CONTAINER_PORT}` value as appropriate.

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning">}}
`minikube tunnel` ([docs](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/))
does not support UDP ([Github Issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/12362)) on some combination of
operating system, platforms and drivers, but is required when using the `Service` workaround.
{{< /alert >}}

### Use a different driver

If you cannot connect through the `Service`or use other workarounds, you may want to try a different
[minikube driver](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/), and if that doesn't work, connection via UDP may not
be possible with minikube, and you may want to try either a
[different local Kubernetes tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) or use a cloud hosted Kubernetes cluster.
