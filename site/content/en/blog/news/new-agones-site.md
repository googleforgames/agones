Welcome to the new Agones website!

We've implemented a new website, to enable lots of new functionality that we're hoping to
take advantage of now and in the future:

- Ability to support multiple languages
- Able to write documentation for new features, but keep them hidden until they are released.
- Search!
- Pretty Pictures! üòä
- Easy access to older versions of the documentation

Big thanks to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for being the static site generator, and the
[docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) team for the core documentation theme üëç
