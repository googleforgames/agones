This is the 1.52.1 release of Agones.

In this release, several improvements have been made to testing and error reporting, including new webhook autoscaler e2e tests and updated error fields in processor proto. Helm support has been enhanced with new strategy options, additional permissions for uninstall, and full test coverage on the latest Helm version. The kubectl image has been updated to a lighter alpine-based build for efficiency, and the hardcoded GameServer list limit has been replaced with a configurable gameservers.lists.maxItems option. Finally, Golang has been upgraded to 1.24.6, along with related dependencies, bringing performance, stability, and security improvements.

- **Configurable GameServer List Limits:** A new configuration option, gameservers.lists.maxItems, replaces the previous hardcoded limit, improving scalability and API performance tuning.

- **Helm and Kubectl Updates:** Helm support has been expanded with new options and permissions, and all tests have been aligned to use the latest Helm version. The kubectl image has been switched from bitnami/kubectl to alpine/kubectl, providing a slimmer and more secure runtime environment.

- **Dependency Upgrades:** Golang has been upgraded to **1.24.6** with updated dependencies, ensuring stronger security, compatibility, and performance across the project.

- **Enhanced Testing and Error Reporting:** Added webhook autoscaler e2e tests with fleet metadata, improved processor proto error fields, and updated upgrade tests to log fatal errors for better debugging and observability.
