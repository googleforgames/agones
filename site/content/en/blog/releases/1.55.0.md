This is the 1.55.0 release of Agones

This release improves stability and usability with several key updates. The FleetAutoscaleRequestMetaData feature is now in Beta, allowing the webhook autoscaler to send fleet metadata (such as names, labels, and annotations) with scaling requests. We’ve upgraded to Go 1.25.0 and updated related dependencies and Dockerfiles. The hardcoded SdkServer update list limit has been replaced with a configurable gameservers.lists.maxItems option. New Minikube remote debugging support enables local debugging of the SDK and controller via improved port-forwarding.

- **Upgrade to Golang 1.25.0 and Dependency Updates**: This release includes an upgrade to Go 1.25.0 along with updates to related dependencies and Dockerfiles, ensuring compatibility and improved performance.

- **Promote FleetAutoscaleRequestMetaData to Beta**: The FleetAutoscaleRequestMetaData has been promoted to Beta and is enabled by default. This feature enhances the extended Webhook autoscaler to send fleet metadata with the request.

- **Configurable GameServer List Limits**: Introduces a new configuration field, gameservers.lists.maxItems, replacing the previously hard-coded list cap.  This allows operators to tune how many GameServers can be returned per list request based on cluster size and API performance needs.  The change improves scalability for large fleets and prevents API overloads caused by unbounded list responses.  SDK server updatelists and watchers now respect this configurable limit, ensuring consistent behavior across components.

- **Remote Debugging with Minikube**: Enhancing the local development experience by allowing the SDK and controller to be debugged easily in a Minikube environment. It includes changes to enable debug modes and improve port-forwarding targets so developers can step through code locally.

- **Docsy website themes**: Documentation site to ensure consistent styling and proper content display.  It improves readability and enhances the visual experience when browsing guides, references, and tutorials.  As a result, the documentation now appears clearer and more professional across all pages.

- **Upgrading Base Images to Debian 13 (Trixie)**: This involves modifying Dockerfiles and related build manifests so that standard and distroless images reference the newer Debian release, improving security, support, and alignment with current operating system standards.
