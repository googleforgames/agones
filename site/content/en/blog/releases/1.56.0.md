This is the 1.56.0 release of Agones

This release improves stability and usability with several key updates. The SidecarContainers feature is now in Beta. We have upgraded Hugo and Docsy, and dark mode has been enabled on the site. Node SDK linting has been migrated from ESLint to Biome. A Google Doodle containerized games case study has been added to third-party content. Additionally, an optional agones.metrics.serviceMonitor.additionalLabels map has been added to the Helm chart.

- **Promote SideCarContainers to Beta**: The SideCarContainers has been promoted to Beta and is enabled by default. This feature decouples the SDK lifecycle from the GameServer container lifecycle.

- **Upgrade Hugo and Docsy Updates**: This release includes an upgrade to Hugo 0.152.2 and Docsy 0.13.0, along with updates to related dependencies, ensuring compatibility and improved performance across the website, including shortcodes, menus, the navbar, and other components.

- **Dark Mode Enabled in Website**: Implement dark mode support on the Agones website using a theme toggle with CSS variables.  Enable automatic theme detection based on the user’s system preferences (prefers-color-scheme).  Ensure consistent styling across all pages to enhance accessibility and reduce eye strain.

- **Configurable Release Label for ServiceMonitor in Helm Chart**: Add support for configuring additional labels on ServiceMonitor resources via the Helm chart values.  This enables users to align ServiceMonitor labels with Prometheus or Alloy selector requirements.  Ensures compatibility in environments where scraping is restricted to ServiceMonitors matching specific labels.

- **Migrate Node SDK Linting from ESLint to Biome**: Replace ESLint configuration with Biome for the Node SDK linting setup.  Update project dependencies and scripts to use Biome for linting and formatting tasks. Ensure rule parity and validate code quality checks through CI integration.
