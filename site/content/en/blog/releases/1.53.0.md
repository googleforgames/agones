This is the 1.53.0 release of Agones.

This release introduces a beta Rust SDK and lays the groundwork for WebAssembly (Wasm) Fleet Autoscaling with a new policy type and architectural refactoring. It also includes key bug fixes for List value removal and SDK initialization. The critical WebSocket connectivity fix, which was previously backported to the v1.52.2 patch release, is also included in this release.

- **Rust SDK (Beta) Counters and Lists Integration**: Added initial implementation for the Rust SDK, integrating its beta features, including the Counter and List state management functionalities. This change also introduces unit tests for the Rust SDK and new conformance tests to ensure proper behavior within the Agones system. 

- **Ensured SDK Server Runs First in Init Containers**: Corrected the container injection logic from using *append* (which put the Agones SDK last) to using a prepend/concat operation.

- **List Value Removal Reliability**: Corrected a bug in the SDK Server that prevented reliable removal of values from the experimental SDK List when those values were part of a pending batch update, ensuring consistent List state.

- **Restored Real-Time WebSocket Connection (SDK)**: Fixed a deadlock introduced by an upstream dependency upgrade (*in grpc-gateway/v2*) that caused the */watch/gameserver* WebSocket to hang.
Note: This critical fix was also backported and is available in the v1.52.2 patch release.

- **FleetAutoscaler Architecture Improvement**: We've refactored the internal structure of the *fasThread* to introduce a dedicated local state map. This foundational work sets the stage for advanced future features, such as the upcoming support for WebAssembly (Wasm)-based custom autoscaling plugins. This feature remains under active development and is not yet available.

- **New Policy Type: WebAssembly (Wasm) Fleet Autoscaling**:  Introduced Wasm as a new policy type option for the *FleetAutoscaler* CRD. This involved defining a new Wasm policy schema (*function, config, from.url, and hash*) and refactoring existing webhook templates into a reusable *url.configuration* template.
