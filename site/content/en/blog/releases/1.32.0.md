This is the 1.32.0 release of Agones.

This upgrade ensures that your game servers are equipped with the latest tools and improvements, enhancing their overall performance and stability:

- Upgrade to Go version 1.20.
- The ResetMetricsOnDelete feature is now beta and enabled by default. Now when a Fleet or FleetAutoscaler is deleted from the system, Agones will automatically clear metrics that utilize their name as a label from the exported metrics, so the metrics exported do not continuously grow in size over the lifecycle of the Agones installation.
- The PodHostname feature that allows you to access a GameServer Pod within a cluster by a DNS name is now beta and enabled by default.
- The SplitControllerAndExtensions feature which splits the Agones controller into multiple binaries for better reliability is now beta and enabled by default.
- The SafeToEvict feature has been promoted to stable.

We encourage you to take advantage of these promoted features to enhance the stability, performance, and functionality of your game servers.
