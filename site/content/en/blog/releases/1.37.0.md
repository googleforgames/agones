This is the 1.37.0 release of Agones.

This release sees the first milestone of a over-a-year series of work on the functionality of arbitrary Counters and Lists attached to each GameServer!

We’ve also upgraded the following features: CountsAndLists to alpha, FleetAllocationOverflow to Beta, and PodHostName, ResetMetricsOnDelete, and SplitControllerAndExtensions to Stable - with defaults below.

- CountsAndLists: This feature flag provides functionality for a configurable set of Counters or Lists be attached to GameServers with attached allocation and autoscaling functionality to provide a flexible implementation that can handle a wide range of use cases such as player tracking, high density game server room tracking, and could even be used for game specific game server allocation prioritization.

  Documentation is a little sparse in this release, but will grow! We’re focusing on the reference material first and will then expand into more in-depth guides and integration patterns.

  **Note**: Counters and Lists will eventually replace the Alpha functionality of Player Tracking, which will subsequently be removed from Agones. If you are currently using this Alpha feature, we would love for you to test (and ideally migrate to!) this new functionality to ensure it will meet all your needs.

- FleetAllocationOverflow: Labels and/or annotations to GameServers that exceed the desired number of replicas in a GameServerSet. This occurs when the allocation of GameServers surpasses the specified replica count.

- PodHostName: Enables the assignment of the GameServer’s name as the PodHostname.

- ResetMetricsOnDelete: This feature instructs the metrics service to unregister and then re-register the relevant metrics view to reset their state immediately whenever an Agones resource is deleted.

- SplitControllerAndExtensions: This feature introduces an important change in Agones for high availability. It separates the system's responsibilities into two binaries: the `controller`, which now handles Kubernetes object monitoring and uses a leader election system to keep only one active controller at a time, and a new horizontally scalable `extensions` binary, focused on managing webhook endpoints.
