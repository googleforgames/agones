This is the 1.54.0 release of Agones.

Agones now supports Kubernetes 1.32,1.33,1.34 and introduces a new Counter feature that improves state management and visibility in the GameServer resource, along with a fix for a related update issue. Autoscaler configuration is easier thanks to removing the caBundle requirement for standard HTTPS endpoints. A major bug affecting missing Agones SDK environment variables in Init Containers has been resolved. This release graduates AutopilotPassthroughPort to Stable, enabling direct node-to-GameServer communication on GKE Autopilot

- **Updated Kubernetes Version Support (v1.32, v1.33, v1.34)**: Agones now officially supports Kubernetes versions 1.32, 1.33, and 1.34, ensuring compatibility with the latest Kubernetes releases for improved performance and stability.

- **Improved Reliability for Counter Updates**: An issue where the SDK's UpdateCounter call did not return the updated Counter values has been fixed. This correction ensures that developers immediately receive accurate count and capacity data upon successful update.

- **Counter Status Visibility Added**: The current state (Count and Capacity) of the GameServer Counters is now exposed in the GameServer status. This allows external systems, like Allocators or FleetAutoscalers, to easily read the counter status from the Kubernetes resource.

- **Simplified Autoscaler HTTPS Configuration**: The Autoscaler no longer requires a caBundle when accessing standard HTTPS webhook or WASM URLs served by a trusted certificate authority. This change simplifies configuration for auto scaling logic.

- **Agones SDK Environment Variables for Init Containers**: Fixed an issue where Agones SDK environment variables (like GRPC and HTTP ports) were not being injected into GameServer Init Containers. This correction ensures your Init Containers can communicate with the Agones SDK server during setup, enabling complex initialization logic before the main game server starts.

- **Autopilot Passthrough Port Graduation to Stable**: The AutopilotPassthroughPort feature has been graduated to Stable. This allows complex game server architectures to expose specific ports that bypass the Agones sidecar logic for direct node-to-GameServer communication.
