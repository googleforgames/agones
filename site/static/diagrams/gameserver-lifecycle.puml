== GameServer Start ==

Agones -> GameServer: GameServer created through\na <i>Fleet</i> configuration
activate GameServer
GameServer -> Binary: Agones creates a Pod with the\nconfigured Game Server Container
activate Binary
activate SDK
Binary -> SDK: SDK.Health()

  <i>Health()</i> is a continuous
  ping that occurs under
  the configured threshold.
end note
GameServer <-- SDK: Maintains Healthy status
Binary -> SDK: SDK.Ready()

  a GameServer from a pool
  of existing GameServers
  (Usually a <i>Fleet</i>)
end note
K8sAPI -> Agones: Intercepts <i>GameServerAllocation</i>\nrequest
"Agones" -> GameServer: Finds a Ready <i>GameServer</i>,\nsets it to <i>Allocated</i> State
K8sAPI <-- Agones: returns <i>Allocated</i>\nGameServer record
Matchmaker <-- K8sAPI : <i>GameServerAllocation</i> is returned\nwith <i>GameServer</i> details\nincluding IP and port to connect to.
