Player1 -> Matchmaker: Requests a game session
Matchmaker -> Agones: Create: <i>GameServerAllocation</i>
note left
  <i>GameServerAllocation</i> implemented to
  optionally select an already allocated <i>GameServer</i>
  if one exists. At this stage, one does not, so
  Agones will allocate a <i>Ready</i> <i>GameServer</i>.
end note
Agones -> GameServer: Finds a <i>Ready</i> <i>GameServer</i>,\nsets it to <i>Allocated</i> State
Matchmaker <-- Agones : <i>GameServerAllocation</i> is returned\nwith <i>GameServer</i> details\nincluding IP and port to connect to.
Player1 <-- Matchmaker : Returns <i>GameServer</i> connection information
Player1 -> Binary : Connects to game server process
Binary -> SDK : SDK.Alpha.PlayerConnect(id)
note right
  Process calls <i>PlayerConnect(...)</i>
  on player client connection.
end note
GameServer <-- SDK : Increments <i>Status.Players.Count</i>\nand add <i>id</i> to <i>Status.Players.Ids</i>

== Allocated <i>GameServers</i> with player(s) on them ==

Player2 -> Matchmaker: Requests a game session
Matchmaker -> Agones: Create: <i>GameServerAllocation</i>
note left
  The <i>GameServerAllocation</i> will this time
  find the Allocated <i>GameServer</i> that "Player One"
  is currently active on.
end note
Agones -> GameServer: Finds the Allocated <i>GameServer</i>\nwith player capacity.
note right
  This is the same <i>GameServer</i> that "Player One"
  is currently playing on.
end note
Matchmaker <-- Agones: returns <i>Allocated GameServer</i> record
Player2 <-- Matchmaker : Returns <i>GameServer</i> connection information
Player2 -> Binary : Connects to game server process
Binary -> SDK : SDK.Alpha.PlayerConnect(id)
