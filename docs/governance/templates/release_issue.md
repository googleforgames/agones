- [ ] Have permission to publish new versions of the App Engine application.
- [ ] Have write access to Agones GitHub repository.
- [ ] Run `git remote -v` and see:
  - [ ] An `origin` remote that points to a personal fork of Agones, such as `git@github.com:yourname/agones.git`.
  - [ ] An `upstream` remote that points to `git@github.com:googleforgames/agones.git`.
- [ ] Have a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with repo permissions.
- [ ] Have a `gcloud config configurations` configuration called `agones-images` that points to the same project.

## Steps

- [ ] Run `make shell` and run `gcloud config configurations activate agones-images`.
- [ ] Review [closed issues with no milestone](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+no%3Amilestone++-label%3Ainvalid+-label%3Aduplicate+-label%3Aquestion+-label%3Awontfix++-label%3Aarea%2Fmeta) and add relevant ones to the current milestone.
  - Issues tagged as `invalid`, `duplicate`, `question`, `wontfix`, or `area/meta` don't need review.
- [ ] Review closed issues in the current milestone to ensure that they have appropriate tags.
- [ ] Review [merged PRs that have no milestone](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+no%3Amilestone+) and add them to the current milestone.
- [ ] Review merged PRs in the current milestone to ensure that they have appropriate tags.
- [ ] Ensure the next stable releases in the Google Calendar have the correct version number.
- [ ] Ensure the next version milestone is created.
- [ ] Any issues in the current milestone that are not closed, move to next milestone.
- [ ] `git checkout main && git pull --rebase upstream main`
- [ ] Run `make release-deploy-site`
      - For example, if you are creating the {version} release, then this would deploy the {version}-1 service (release minus one, and then replace dots with dashes)
- [ ] Run `make build-release` to ensure all example images exist on us-docker.pkg.dev/agones-images/examples.
- [ ] Ensure the [helm `tag` value][values] is correct (tag field value in image should be {version})
- [ ] Ensure the [helm `Chart` version values][chart] are correct (appVersion and version fields value should be {version})
- [ ] Update SDK Package Versions
  - [ ] Navigate to the `sdks/nodejs` directory and run `npm version {version}` to update the package version in [`sdks/nodejs/package.json`][package.json] and [`sdks/nodejs/package-lock.json`][package-lock.json]
  - [ ] Ensure the [`sdks/csharp/sdk/AgonesSDK.nuspec` and `sdks/csharp/sdk/csharp-sdk.csproj`][csharp] versions are correct (package -> version field value in AgonesSDK.nuspec and PropertyGroup -> Version field value in csharp-sdk.csproj should be {version})
  - [ ] Update the package version in the [`sdks/unity/package.json`][unity] package file's `version` field to {version}
- [ ] Run `make gen-install`
- [ ] Create a _draft_ release with the [release template][release-template].
  - run `make release-example-image-markdown` to populate example images and append the output in `Images available with this release` section
  - [ ] Draft a new release with [release draft][release-draft]. Update the `Tag version` and `Release title` with the release version and click on `Generate release notes` to generate the release notes with `Full Changelog` info for {version}. Make sure to add the description. Include the `Images available with this release` section from the previous step that will be present after the `Full Changelog` and save the draft.
  - [ ] copy the {version} release details from the `Full Changelog` and paste it on top of the CHANGELOG.md file
- [ ] Site updated
  - [ ] Create a new file named {version}.md in `/site/content/en/blog/releases`. Copy the draft release content in this file (this will be what you send via email)[refer the previous release file].
  - run `make site-server` frequently to make sure everything looks fine for the release in your localhost
  - [ ] In `site/content/en/docs/Installation/_index.md #agones-and-kubernetes-supported-versions`, for the current version, replace `{{% k8s-version %}}` with hardcoded Kubernetes versions supported by the current version. And add a row for the Agones release version with `{{% k8s-version %}}` as its supported Kubernetes versions.
  - [ ] Review all `link_test` and `data-proofer-ignore` attributes and remove for link testing [delete `data-proofer-ignore` from the release file of previous version]
  - [ ] Review and remove all instances of the `feature` shortcode.
    - Ignore html and release files.
    - remove the `feature expiryVersion` block with content. remove only the block of `feature publishVersion` and do not remove the content.
    - In helm.md file, merge the rows that are present in the `New Configurations Features` table into the above `Configuration` table. The `New Configurations Features` table gets left in place (but empty) and the publishVersion bumped to the next upcoming release.
  - [ ] Add a link to previous version's documentation to nav dropdown in `site/layouts/partials/navbar.html`

    - [ ] Copy `dev_minikube_example_cluster_version` to `minikube_example_cluster_version`.
    - [ ] Update documentation with updated example images tags.
- [ ] Create PR with these changes, and merge them with an approval.
- [ ] Run `git remote update && git checkout main && git reset --hard upstream/main` to ensure your code is in line
      with upstream (unless this is a hotfix, then do the same, but for the release branch)
- [ ] Publish SDK packages
  - [ ] Run `make sdk-shell-node` to get interactive shell to publish node package. Requires Google internal process
        to publish.
  - [ ] Run `make sdk-publish-csharp` to deploy to NuGet. Requires login credentials.
        Will need [NuGet API Key](https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys) from Agones account.
- [ ] Run `make do-release` to create and push the docker images and helm chart.
- [ ] Run `make shell` and run `gcloud config configurations activate <your development project>` to switch Agones
      development tooling off of the `agones-images` project.
- [ ] Do a `helm repo add agones https://agones.dev/chart/stable` / `helm repo update` and verify that the new
      version is available via the command `helm search repo agones --versions --devel`.
- [ ] Do a `helm install --namespace=agones-system agones agones/agones` or `helm install --create-namespace --namespace=agones-system agones agones/agones` if the namespace was deleted and a smoke test to confirm everything is working.
