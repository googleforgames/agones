# Load and performance tests

Load tests aim to test the performance of the system under heavy load. For Agones, game server allocation is an example where heavy load and multiple parallel operations can be envisioned.

The goal of performance tests is to provide metrics on various operations. For
Agones, fleet scaling is a good example where performance metrics are useful.
