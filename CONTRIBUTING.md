# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

## Submitting code via Pull Requests

- We follow the [Github Pull Request Model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for
  all contributions.
- For large bodies of work, we recommend creating an issue and labelling it
  "[kind/design](https://github.com/googleprivate/agones/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fdesign)"
  outlining the feature that you wish to build, and describing how it will be implemented. This gives a chance
  for review to happen early, and ensures no wasted effort occurs.
- All submissions, including submissions by project members, will require review before being merged.
- Once review has occurred, please rebase your PR down to a single commit. This will ensure a nice clean Git history.
- Finally - *Thanks* for considering submitting code to Agones!
