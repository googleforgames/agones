                  portPolicy has three options:
                  - "Dynamic" (default) the system allocates a random free hostPort for the gameserver, for game clients to connect to
                  - "Static", user defines the hostPort that the game client will connect to. Then onus is on the user to ensure that the
                  port is available. When static is the policy specified, `hostPort` is required to be populated
                  - "Passthrough" dynamically sets the `containerPort` to the same value as the dynamically selected hostPort.
                  This will mean that users will need to lookup what port has been opened through the server side SDK.
