                  portPolicy has three options:
                  - "Dynamic" (default) the system allocates a random free hostPort for the gameserver, for game clients to connect to
                  - "Static", user defines the hostPort that the game client will connect to. Then onus is on the user to ensure that the
                  port is available. When static is the policy specified, `hostPort` is required to be populated
                  - "Passthrough" dynamically sets the `containerPort` to the same value as the dynamically selected hostPort.
                  This will mean that users will need to lookup what port has been opened through the server side SDK.

Evictions from node upgrades proceed normally.
              - Always: On SIGTERM, the game server will exit within `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` or be terminated, typically within 10m; Agones sets Pod annotation `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "true"`, which allows evictions by Cluster Autoscaler.
