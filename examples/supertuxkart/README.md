# SuperTuxKart Game Server Example

Example using a [SuperTuxKart](https://supertuxkart.net/) dedicated game server.

This example wraps the SuperTuxKart server with a [Go](https://golang.org) binary, and introspects
the log file to provide the event hooks for the SDK integration.

It is not a direct integration, but is an approach to integrate with existing
dedicated game servers.

You will need to download the SuperTuxKart client separately to play.

For detailed instructions refer to the [Agones Documentation](https://agones.dev/site/docs/examples/supertuxkart/).
