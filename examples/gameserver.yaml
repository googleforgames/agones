# Full example of a single Game Server resource
#
# This specifies Game Server specific configuration, but provides
# a Pod Template so that Pod options and capabilities are available.
# This definition sets hostPort + containerPort combo for the game server,
# and provides a sidecar for this game server that the SDK will connect with.

apiVersion: "agones.dev/v1"
kind: GameServer
metadata:
  # generateName: "gds-example" # generate a unique name, with the given prefix
  name: "gds-example" # set a fixed name
spec:
  # if there is more than one container, specify which one is the game server
  container: example-server
  # Array of ports that can be exposed as direct connections to the game server container
  ports:
    # name is a descriptive name for the port
  - name: default
    # portPolicy has three options:
    # - "Dynamic" (default) the system allocates a free hostPort for the gameserver, for game clients to connect to
    # - "Static", user defines the hostPort that the game client will connect to. Then onus is on the user to ensure that the
    # port is available. When static is the policy specified, `hostPort` is required to be populated
    # - "Passthrough" dynamically sets the `containerPort` to the same value as the dynamically selected hostPort.
    #      This will mean that users will need to lookup what port has been opened through the server side SDK.
    portPolicy: Static
    # The name of the container to open the port on. Defaults to the game server container if omitted or empty.
    container: simple-game-server
    # the port that is being opened on the game server process
    containerPort: 7654
    # the port exposed on the host, only required when `portPolicy` is "Static". Overwritten when portPolicy is "Dynamic".
    hostPort: 7777
    # protocol being used. Defaults to UDP. TCP and TCPUDP are other options
    protocol: UDP
  # Health checking for the running game server
  health:
    # Disable health checking. defaults to false, but can be set to true
    disabled: false
    # Number of seconds after the container has started before health check is initiated. Defaults to 5 seconds
    initialDelaySeconds: 5
    # If the `Health()` function doesn't get called at least once every period (seconds), then
    # the game server is not healthy. Defaults to 5
    periodSeconds: 5
    # Minimum consecutive failures for the health probe to be considered failed after having succeeded.
    # Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1
    failureThreshold: 3
  # Parameters for game server sidecar
  sdkServer:
    # sdkServer log level parameter has three options:
    #  - "Info" (default) The SDK server will output all messages except for debug messages
    #  - "Debug" The SDK server will output all messages including debug messages
    #  - "Error" The SDK server will only output error messages
    logLevel: Info
    # grpcPort and httpPort control what ports the sdkserver listens on.
    # Starting with Agones 1.2 the default grpcPort is 9357 and the default
    # httpPort is 9358. In earlier releases, the defaults were 59357 and 59358
    # respectively but as these were in the ephemeral port range they could
    # conflict with other TCP connections.
