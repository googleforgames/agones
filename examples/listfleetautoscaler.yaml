      # BufferSize is the size of a buffer based on the List capacity that is available over the current
      # aggregate List length in the Fleet (available capacity).
      # It can be specified either as an absolute value (i.e. 5) or percentage format (i.e. 5%).

      # MinCapacity is the minimum aggregate List total capacity across the fleet.
      # If BufferSize is specified as a percentage, MinCapacity is required must be greater than 0.

      # MaxCapacity is the maximum aggregate List total capacity across the fleet.
