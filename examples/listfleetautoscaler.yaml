# Example of a FleetAutoscaler - this is used to scale a Fleet automatically depending on the
# available capacity of a List across the fleet.

      # Size of a buffer based on the list capacity that is available over the current aggregate
      # list length in the Fleet (available capacity).
      # bufferSize can be specified either in absolute (i.e. 5) or percentage format (i.e. 5%)
      # Required.

      # Minimum aggregate list capacity that can be provided by this FleetAutoscaler.
      # If minCapacity is not specified, the effective minimum capacity will be bufferSize.
      # When bufferSize in percentage format is used, minCapacity should be set and more than 0.
      minCapacity: 10
      # Maximum aggregate list capacity that can be provided by this FleetAutoscaler.
      # Required.
