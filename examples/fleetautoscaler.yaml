apiVersion: "autoscaling.agones.dev/v1"
kind: FleetAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: fleet-autoscaler-example
spec:
  # The name of the fleet to attach to and control. Must be an existing Fleet in the same namespace
  # as this FleetAutoscaler
  fleetName: fleet-example
  # The autoscaling policy
  policy:
    # type of the policy. Buffer or Webhook types are available
    type: Buffer
    # parameters of the buffer policy
    buffer:
      # Size of a buffer of "ready" and "reserved" game server instances.
      # The FleetAutoscaler will scale the fleet up and down trying to maintain this buffer, 
      # as instances are being allocated or terminated.
      # Note that "reserved" game servers could not be scaled down.
      # It can be specified either in absolute (i.e. 5) or percentage format (i.e. 5%)
      bufferSize: 5
      # minimum fleet size to be set by this FleetAutoscaler. 
      # if not specified, the actual minimum fleet size will be bufferSize
      minReplicas: 10
      # maximum fleet size that can be set by this FleetAutoscaler
      # required
      maxReplicas: 20

  # The autoscaling sync strategy
  sync:
    # type of the sync. for now, only FixedInterval is available
