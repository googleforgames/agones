      # Size of a buffer of counted items that are available in the Fleet (available capacity).
      # bufferSize can be specified either in absolute (i.e. 5) or percentage format (i.e. 5%).

      # Minimum aggregate counter capacity that can be provided by this FleetAutoscaler.
      # If minCapacity is not specified, the effective minimum capacity will be bufferSize.
      # When bufferSize in percentage format is used, minCapacity should be set and more than 0.
