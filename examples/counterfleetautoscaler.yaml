# Example of a FleetAutoscaler - this is used to scale a Fleet automatically depending on the
# available capacity of a Counter across the fleet.

    type: Counter  # Counter based autoscaling
    counter:
      # Key is the name of the Counter. Required field.

      # BufferSize is the size of a buffer of counted items that are available in the Fleet (available capacity).
      # Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of the Counter available capacity (ex: 5%).
      # An absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. Must be bigger than 0. Required field.
      bufferSize: 5
      # MinCapacity is the minimum aggregate Counter total capacity across the fleet.
      # If BufferSize is specified as a percentage, MinCapacity is required and cannot be 0.
      # If non zero, MinCapacity must be smaller than MaxCapacity and must be greater than or equal to BufferSize.
      minCapacity: 10
      # MaxCapacity is the maximum aggregate Counter total capacity across the fleet.
      # MaxCapacity must be greater than or equal to both MinCapacity and BufferSize. Required field.
