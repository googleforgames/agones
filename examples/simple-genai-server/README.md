# Simple Game Server for GenAI

A simple game server that serves as an example of how to integrate GenAI endpoints into your
dedicated game server. You can either interact with one GenAI endpoint via TCP, or set up two
endpoints to "chat" to each other.

For detailed instructions refer to the [Agones Documentation](https://agones.dev/site/docs/examples/simple-genai-gameserver/).
