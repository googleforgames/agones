    # The replacement strategy for when the GameServer template is changed. Default option is "RollingUpdate",
    # "RollingUpdate" will increment by maxSurge value on each iteration, while decrementing by maxUnavailable on each
    # iteration, until all GameServers have been switched from one version to another.
    # "Recreate" terminates all non-allocated GameServers, and starts up a new set with the new details to replace them.
