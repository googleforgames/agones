# Xonotic Example

Example using a [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org) dedicated game server.

This example wraps the Xonotic server with a [Go](https://golang.org) binary, and introspects
stdout to provide the event hooks for the SDK integration.

It is not a direct integration, but is an approach for to integrate with existing
dedicated game servers.

You will need to download the Xonotic client separately to play.

For detailed instructions refer to the [Agones Documentation](https://agones.dev/site/docs/examples/xonotic/).
