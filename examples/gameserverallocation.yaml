# Full example of a GameServerAllocation. This is used to allocate
# A GameServer out of a set of GameServers. This could be a Fleet,
# multiple Fleets, or a self managed group of GameServers.

apiVersion: "allocation.agones.dev/v1"
kind: GameServerAllocation
spec:
  # GameServer selector from which to choose GameServers from.
  # GameServers still have the hard requirement to be `Ready` to be allocated from
  # however we can also make available `matchExpressions` for even greater
  # flexibility.
  # Below is an example of a GameServer allocated against a given fleet.
  # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more details
  # The selectors is an ordered list of allocations set.
  # If the first selector is not matched, the selection attempts the second selector, and so on.
  # This is useful for things like smoke testing of new game servers.
  # This also support `matchExpressions`
  selectors:
    - matchLabels:
        agones.dev/fleet: green-fleet
    - matchLabels:
        agones.dev/fleet: blue-fleet
    - matchLabels:
        game: my-game
      matchExpressions:
      - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [cache]}
      # [Stage:Beta]
      # [FeatureFlag:StateAllocationFilter]
      # Specifies which State is the filter to be used when attempting to retrieve a GameServer
      # via Allocation. Defaults to "Ready". The only other option is "Allocated", which can be used in conjunction with
      # label/annotation/player selectors to retrieve an already Allocated GameServer.
      gameServerState: Ready
      # [Stage:Alpha]
      # [FeatureFlag:PlayerAllocationFilter]
      # Provides a filter on minimum and maximum values for player capacity when retrieving a GameServer
      # through Allocation. Defaults to no limits.
      players:
        minAvailable: 0
        maxAvailable: 99
  # defines how GameServers are organised across the cluster.
  # Options include:
  # "Packed" (default) is aimed at dynamic Kubernetes clusters, such as cloud providers, wherein we want to bin pack
  # resources
  # "Distributed" is aimed at static Kubernetes clusters, wherein we want to distribute resources across the entire
  # cluster
  scheduling: Packed
  # Optional custom metadata that is added to the game server at allocation
  # You can use this to tell the server necessary session data
