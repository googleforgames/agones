# Simple Game Server

A very simple "toy" game server created to demo and test running a UDP and/or
TCP game server on Agones.

To learn how to deploy your edited version of go server to gcp, please check
out this link: [Edit Your First Game Server (Go)](https://agones.dev/site/docs/getting-started/edit-first-gameserver-go/),
or also look at the [`Makefile`](./Makefile).

## Interacting with the Server

When the server receives a text packet, it will send back "ACK:<text content>"
for UDP as an echo or "ACK TCP:<text content>" for TCP.

There are some text commands you can send the server to affect its behavior:

| Command                | Behavior                                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "EXIT"                 | Causes the game server to exit cleanly calling `os.Exit(0)`                              |
| "UNHEALTHY"            | Stopping sending health checks                                                           |
| "GAMESERVER"           | Sends back the game server name                                                          |
| "READY"                | Marks the server as Ready                                                                |

| "CRASH"                | Causes the game server to exit / crash immediately                                       |

## Configuration

The server has a few configuration options that can be set via command line
flags. Some can also be set using environment variables.
