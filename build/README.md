# Developing, Testing and Building Agones

Tooling for building and developing against Agones, with only dependencies being
[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

Rather than installing all the dependencies locally, you can test and build Agones using the Docker image that is
built from the Dockerfile in this directory. There is an accompanying Makefile for all the common
tasks you may wish to accomplish.

## Building on Different Platforms

### Linux
- Install Make, either via `apt install make` or `yum install make` depending on platform.
- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for your Linux platform.

### Windows
Building and developing Agones requires you to use the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/)(WSL),
as this makes it easy to create a (relatively) cross platform development and build system.

- [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
  - Preferred release is [Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6) or greater.
- [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- Within WSL, Install [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- Follow [this guide](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly)
  from "Configure WSL to Connect to Docker for Windows" forward
  for integrating the Docker on WSL with the Windows Docker installation
  - Note the binding of `/c` to `/mnt/c` (or drive of your choice) - this is very important!
- Agones will need to be cloned somewhere on your `/c` (or drive of your choice) path, as that is what Docker will support mounts from
- All interaction with Agones must be on the `/c` (or drive of your choice) path, otherwise Docker mounts will not work
- Now the `make` commands can all be run from within your WSL shell
- The Minikube setup on Windows has not been tested. Pull Requests would be appreciated!

### macOS

- Install Make, `brew install make`, if it's not installed already
- Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

## Testing and Building

Make sure you are in the `build` directory to start.

First, let's test the Agones system code. To do this, run `make test-go`, which will execute all the unit tests for
the Go codebase (there are other tests, but they can take a long time to run).

If you haven't run any of Make targets before then this will also create the Docker based build
image, and then run the tests.

Building the build image may take a few minutes to download all the dependencies, so feel
free to make cup of tea or coffee at this point. ☕️

**Note**: If you get build errors and you followed all the instructions so far, consult the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section

The build image is only created the first time one of the make targets is executed, and will only rebuild if the build
Dockerfile has changed.

Assuming that the tests all pass, let's go ahead and compile the code and build the Docker images that Agones
consists of.

To compile the Agones images, run `make build-images`. This is often all you need for Agones development.

If you want to compile and build everything (this can take a while), run `make build`, this will:

- Compile the Agones Kubernetes integration code
- Create the Docker images that we will later push
- Build the local development tooling for all supported OS's
- Compile and archive the SDKs in various languages

You may note that docker images, and tar archives are tagged with a concatenation of the
upcoming release number and short git hash for the current commit. This has also been set in
the code itself, so that it can be seen in via log statements.

Congratulations! You have now successfully tested and built Agones!

### Running a Test Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster

This will setup a test GKE cluster on Google Cloud, with firewall rules set for each of the nodes for ports 7000-8000
to be open to UDP traffic.

First step is to create a Google Cloud Project at https://console.cloud.google.com or reuse an existing one.

The build tools (by default) maintain configuration for gcloud within the `build` folder, to keep
everything separate (see below for overwriting these config locations). Therefore, once the project has been created,
we will need to authenticate our gcloud tooling against it. To do that run `make gcloud-init` and fill in the
prompts as directed.

Once authenticated, to create the test cluster, run `make gcloud-test-cluster`
(or run `make gcloud-e2e-test-cluster` for end to end tests), which will use the Terraform configuration found in the `build/terraform/gke` directory.

You can customize the GKE cluster by appending the following parameters to your make target, via environment
variables, or by setting them within your
[`local-includes`](#set-local-make-targets-and-variables-with-local-includes) directory. For end to end tests, update `GCP_CLUSTER_NAME` to e2e-test-cluster
in the Makefile.

See the table below for available customizations :

| Parameter                                      | Description                                                                           | Default         |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NAME`                             | The name of the cluster                                                               | `test-cluster`  |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_ZONE` or `GCP_CLUSTER_LOCATION`   | The name of the Google Compute Engine zone/location in which the cluster will resides | `us-west1-c`    |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_AUTOSCALE`               | Whether or not to enable autoscaling on game server nodepool                          | `false`         |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_MIN_NODECOUNT`           | The number of minimum nodes if autoscale is enabled                                   | `1`             |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_MAX_NODECOUNT`           | The number of maximum nodes if autoscale is enabled                                   | `5`             |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_INITIALNODECOUNT`        | The number of nodes to create in this cluster.                                        | `4`             |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_MACHINETYPE`             | The name of a Google Compute Engine machine type.                                     | `e2-standard-4` |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_ENABLEIMAGESTREAMING`    | Whether or not to enable image streaming for the `"default"` node pool in the cluster | `true`          |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_WINDOWSINITIALNODECOUNT` | The number of Windows nodes to create in this cluster.                                | `0`             |
| `GCP_CLUSTER_NODEPOOL_WINDOWSMACHINETYPE`      | The name of a Google Compute Engine machine type for Windows nodes.                   | `e2-standard-4` |

This will take several minutes to complete, but once done you can go to the Google Cloud Platform console and see that
a cluster is up and running!

To grab the kubectl authentication details for this cluster, run `make gcloud-auth-cluster`, which will generate the
required Kubernetes security credentials for `kubectl`. This will be stored in `~/.kube/config` by default, but can also be
overwritten by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable before running the command.

Great! Now we are setup, let's try out the development shell, and see if our `kubectl` is working!

Run `make shell` to enter the development shell. You should see a bash shell that has you as the root user.
Enter `kubectl get pods` and press enter. You should see that you have no resources currently, but otherwise see no errors.
Assuming that all works, let's exit the shell by typing `exit` and hitting enter, and look at building, pushing and
installing Agones next.

To prepare building and pushing images, let's set the REGISTRY environment variable to point to our new project.
You can choose either Google Container Registry or Google Artifact Registry but you must set it explicitly.
For this guidance, we will use Google Artifact Registry.
You can [choose any registry region](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling)
but for this example, we'll just use `us-docker.pkg.dev`.
Please follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#before_you_begin) to create the registry
in your project properly before you contine.

In your shell, run `export REGISTRY=us-docker.pkg.dev/<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>/<YOUR-REGISTRY-NAME>` which will set the required `REGISTRY` parameters in our
Make targets. Then, to rebuild our images for this registry, we run `make build-images` again.

Before we can push the images, there is one more small step! So that we can run regular `docker push` commands
(rather than `gcloud docker -- push`), we have to authenticate against the registry, which will give us a short
lived key for our local docker config. To do this, run `make gcloud-auth-docker`, and now we have the short lived tokens.

To push our images up at this point, is simple `make push` and that will push up all images you just built to your
project's container registry.

Now that the images are pushed, to install the development version (with all imagePolicies set to always download),
run `make install` and Agones will install the image that you just built and pushed on the test cluster you
created at the beginning of this section. (if you want to see the resulting installation yaml, you can find it in `build/.install.yaml`)

Finally, to run all the end-to-end tests against your development version previously installed in your test cluster run
`make test-e2e` (this can also take a while). This will validate the whole application flow from start to finish. If
you're curious about how they work head to [tests/e2e](../test/e2e/).
Also [see below](#running-individual-end-to-end-tests) for how to run individual end-to-end tests during development.

When you are finished, you can run `make clean-gcloud-test-cluster` (or
`make clean-gcloud-e2e-test-cluster`) to tear down your cluster.

### Running a Test Minikube cluster
This will setup a [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) cluster, running on an `agones` profile,

Because Minikube runs on a virtualisation layer on the host (usually Docker), some of the standard build and development
 Make targets need to be replaced by Minikube specific targets.

First, [install Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation).

Next we will create the Agones Minikube cluster. Run `make minikube-test-cluster` to create the `agones` profile,
and a Kubernetes cluster of the supported version under this profile.

This will also install the kubectl authentication credentials in `~/.kube`, and set the
[`kubectl` context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
to `agones`.

Great! Now we are setup, let's try out the development shell, and see if our `kubectl` is working!

Run `make minikube-shell` to enter the development shell. You should see a bash shell that has you as the root user.
Enter `kubectl get pods` and press enter. You should see that you have no resources currently, but otherwise see no errors.
Assuming that all works, let's exit the shell by typing `exit` and hitting enter, and look at a building, pushing and
installing Agones on Minikube next.

You may remember in the first part of this walkthrough, we ran `make build-images`, which created all the images and binaries
we needed to work with Agones locally. We can push these images them straight into Minikube very easily!

Run `make minikube-push` which will send all of Agones's docker images from your local Docker into the Agones Minikube
instance.

Now that the images are pushed, to install the development version,
run `make minikube-install` and Agones will install the images that you built and pushed to the Agones Minikube instance
(if you want to see the resulting installation yaml, you can find it in `build/.install.yaml`).

It's worth noting that Minikube does let you [reuse its Docker daemon](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/#1-pushing-directly-to-the-in-cluster-docker-daemon-docker-env),
and build directly on Minikube, but in this case this approach is far simpler,
and makes cross-platform support for the build system much easier.

To push your own images into the cluster, take a look at Minikube's
[Pushing Images](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/) guide.

Running end-to-end tests on Minikube can be done via the `make minikube-test-e2e` target, but this can often overwhelm
a local minikube cluster, so use at your own risk. Take a look at
[Running Individual End-to-End Tests](#running-individual-end-to-end-tests) to run individual tests on a case by case
basis.

If you are getting issues connecting to `GameServers` running on minikube, check the
[Agones minikube](https://agones.dev/site/docs/installation/creating-cluster/minikube/) documentation. You may need to
change the driver version through the `MINIKUBE_DRIVER` variable. See the
[local-includes](#set-local-make-targets-and-variables-with-local-includes) on how to change this permanently on
your development machine.

### Running a Test Kind cluster
 This will setup a [Kubernetes IN Docker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) cluster named agones by default.

Because Kind runs on a docker on the host, some of the standard build and development Make targets
need to be replaced by kind specific targets.

First, [install Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind#installation-and-usage).

Next we will create the Agones Kind cluster. Run `make kind-test-cluster` to create the `agones` Kubernetes cluster.

This will also setup helm and a kubeconfig, the kubeconfig location can found using the following command `kind get kubeconfig-path --name=agones` assuming you're using the default `KIND_PROFILE`.

You can verify that your new cluster information by running (if you don't have kubectl you can skip to the shell section):

```
KUBECONFIG=$(kind get kubeconfig-path --name=agones) kubectl cluster-info
```

Great! Now we are setup, we also provide a development shell with a handful set of tools like kubectl and helm.

Run `make kind-shell` to enter the development shell. You should see a bash shell that has you as the root user.
Enter `kubectl get pods` and press enter. You should see that you have no resources currently, but otherwise see no errors.
Assuming that all works, let's exit the shell by typing `exit` and hitting enter, and look at a building, pushing and installing Agones on Kind next.

You may remember in the first part of this walkthrough, we ran `make build-images`, which created all the images and binaries
we needed to work with Agones locally. We can push these images them straight into kind very easily!

Run `make kind-push` which will send all of Agones's docker images from your local Docker into the Agones Kind container.

Now that the images are pushed, to install the development version,
run `make kind-install` and Agones will install the images that you built and pushed to the Agones Kind cluster.

Running end-to-end tests on Kind is done via the `make kind-test-e2e` target. This target use the same `make test-e2e` but also setup some prerequisites for use with a Kind cluster.

If you are having performance issues, check out these docs [here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#creating-a-cluster)

### Running a Custom Test Environment

This section is addressed to developers using a custom Kubernetes provider, a custom image repository and/or multiple test clusters.

Prerequisites:
- a(some) running k8s cluster(s)
- Have kubeconfig file(s) ready
- docker must be logged into the image repository you're going to use

To begin, you need to set up the following environment variables:
- `KUBECONFIG` should point to the kubeconfig file used to access the cluster;
   if unset, it defaults to `~/.kube/config`
- `REGISTRY` should point to your image repository of your choice (i.e. us-docker.pkg.dev/<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>/<YOUR-REGISTRY-NAME>)
- `IMAGE_PULL_SECRET` must contain the name of the secret required to pull the Agones images,
   in case you're using a custom repository; if unset, no pull secret will be used
- `IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_FILE` must be initialized to the full path of the file containing
   the secret for pulling the Agones images, in case of a custom image repository;
   if set, `make install` will install this secret in both the `agones-system` (for pulling the controller image)
   and `default` (for pulling the sdk image) repositories

Now you're ready to begin the development/test cycle:
- `make build` will build Agones
- `make test` will run local tests, which includes `site-test` target
- `make push` will push the Agones images to your image repository
- `make install` will install/upgrade Agones into your cluster
- `make test-e2e` will run end-to-end tests in your cluster

If you need to clean up your cluster, you can use `make uninstall` to remove Agones.

### Common Development Flows

You can combine some of the above steps into a single one, for example `make build-images push install` is very
common flow, to build you changes on Agones, push them to a container registry and install this development
version to your cluster.

Another would be to run `make lint test-go` to run the golang linter against the Go code, and then run all the unit
tests.

### Set Local Make Targets and Variables with `local-includes`

If you want to permanently set `Makefile` variables or add targets to your local setup, all `local-includes/*.mk`
are included into the main `Makefile`, and also ignored by the git repository.

Therefore, you can add your own `.mk` files in the [`local-includes`](./local-includes) directory without affecting
the shared git repository.

For examaple, if I only worked with Linux images for Agones, I could permanently turn off Windows and Arm64 images,
by writing a `images.mk` within that folder, with the following contents:

```makefile
# Just Linux
WITH_WINDOWS=0
WITH_ARM64=0
```

### Running Individual End-to-End Tests

When you are working on an individual feature of Agones, it doesn't make sense to run the entire end-to-end suite of
tests (and it can take a really long time!).

The end-to-end tests within the [`tests/e2e`](../test/e2e) folder are plain
[Go Tests](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test) that will use your local `~/.kube` configuration to connect and
run against the currently active local cluster.

This means you can run individual e2e tests from within your IDE or as a `go` command.

For example:

```shell
go test -race -run ^TestCreateConnect$
```

#### Troubleshooting
If you run into cluster connection issues, this can usually be resolved by running any kind of authenticated `kubectl`
command from within `make shell` or locally, to refresh your authentication token.

## Make Variable Reference

`docker push` directly. Useful when used in combination with `make push` command.

### Terraform

Utilities for deploying a Kubernetes Engine cluster on Google Cloud Platform using `google` Terraform provider.

#### `make gcloud-terraform-cluster`
Create GKE cluster and install release version of agones.
Run next command to create GKE cluster with agones (version from helm repository):
```
[GKE_PASSWORD="<YOUR_PASSWORD>"] make gcloud-terraform-cluster
```
Where `<YOUR_PASSWORD>` should be at least 16 characters in length. You can omit GKE_PASSWORD and then basic auth would be disabled. Also you change `ports="7000-8000"` setting using tfvars file.
Also you can define password `password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>` string in `build/terraform.tfvars`.
Change AGONES_VERSION to a specific version you want to install.

#### `make gcloud-terraform-install`

make gcloud-terraform-destroy-cluster
```
Singleton, could not be executed in parallel with itself. As it uses the one terraform tfstate file.

### Minikube

A set of utilities for setting up and running a [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) instance,
for local development.

Since Minikube runs locally, there are some targets that need to be used instead of the standard ones above.

#### `make minikube-test-cluster`
Switches to an "agones" profile, and starts a kubernetes cluster
of the right version. Uses "docker" as the default driver.

If needed, use MINIKUBE_DRIVER variable to change the VM driver.

#### `make minikube-install`

Installs the current development version of Agones into the Kubernetes cluster.
Use this instead of `make install`, as it disables PullAlways on the install.yaml

#### `make minikube-push`

Push the local Agones Docker images that have already been built
via `make build` or `make build-images` into the "agones" minikube instance with `minikube cache add`

port forwarding to the grafana deployment.

#### `make minikube-test-e2e`
Runs end-to-end tests on the previously installed version of Agones.
These tests validate Agones flow from start to finish.

⚠ Running all the e2e tests can often overwhelm a local minikube cluster, so use at your own risk. You should look at
[Running Individual End-to-End Tests](#running-individual-end-to-end-tests) to run tests on a case by case basis.

#### `make minikube-shell`
Connecting to Minikube requires so enhanced permissions, so use this target
instead of `make shell` to start an interactive shell for development on Minikube.

#### `make minikube-controller-portforward`
The minikube version of [`make controller-portforward`](#make-controller-portforward) to setup
port forwarding to the controller deployment.

[Kind - kubernetes in docker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes".

Since Kind runs locally, there are some targets that need to be used instead of the standard ones above.

#### `make kind-test-cluster`
Starts a local kubernetes cluster, you can delete it with `make kind-delete-cluster`

Use KIND_PROFILE variable to change the name of the cluster.

## Dependencies

This project uses the [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) as its manager. You can see the list of dependencies [here](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/blob/main/go.mod).

#### Vendoring

Agones uses [module vendoring](https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules_and_vendoring) to reliably produce versioned builds with consistent behavior.

Adding a new dependency to Agones:

*  `go mod tidy` This will import your new deps into the go.mod file and trim out any removed dependencies.
*  `go mod vendor` Pulls module code into the vendor directory.

Sometimes the code added to vendor may not include a subdirectory that houses code being used but not as an import
(protos passed as args to scripts is a good example). In this case you can go into the module cache and copy what you need to the path in vendor.

Here is an example for getting third_party from grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway v1.5.1 into vendor:

*  AGONES_PATH=/wherever/your/agones/path/is
*  cp -R $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway@v1.5.1/third_party $AGONES_PATH/vendor/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/

Note the version in the pathname. Go may eliminate the need to do this in future versions.

We also use vendor to hold code patches while waiting for the project to release the fixes in their own code. An example is in [k8s.io/apimachinery](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/issues/414) where a fix will be released later this year, but we updated our own vendored version in order to fix the issue sooner.


## Troubleshooting

Frequent issues and possible solutions

#### $GOPATH/$GOROOT error when building in WSL

If you get this error when building Agones in WSL (`make build`, `make test` or any other related target):

```can't load package: package agones.dev/agones/cmd/controller: cannot find package "agones.dev/agones/cmd/controller" in any of:
       /usr/local/go/src/agones.dev/agones/cmd/controller (from $GOROOT)
       /go/src/agones.dev/agones/cmd/controller (from $GOPATH)
```

- Are your project files on a different folder than C? If yes, then you should either move them on drive C or set up Docker for Windows to share your project drive as well
- Did you set up the volume mount for Docker correctly? By default, drive C is mapped by WSL as /mnt/c, but Docker expects it as /c. You can test by executing `ls /c` in your linux shell. If you get an error, then follow the instructions for [setting up volume mount for Docker](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly#ensure-volume-mounts-work)

#### Error: cluster-admin-binding already exists

This surfaces while running `make gcloud-auth-cluster`. The solution is to run `kubectl describe clusterrolebinding | grep cluster-admin-binding- -A10`, find clusterrolebinding which belongs to your `User` account and then run `kubectl delete clusterrolebindings cluster-admin-binding-<md5Hash>` where `<md5Hash>` is a value specific to your account. Now you can execute `make gcloud-auth-cluster` again. If you run into a permission denied error when attempting the delete operation, you need to run `sudo chown <your username> <path to .kube/config>` to change ownership of the file to yourself.

#### Error: releases do not exist

Run `make uninstall` then run `make install` again.

#### I want to use pprof to profile the controller.

Run `make build-images GO_BUILD_TAGS=profile` and this will build images with [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)
enabled in the controller, which you can then push and install on your cluster.

To get the pprof ui working, run `make controller-portforward PORT=6060` (or `minikube-controller-portforward PORT=6060` if you are on minikube),
which will setup the port forwarding to the pprof http endpoint.

To view CPU profiling, run `make pprof-cpu-web`, which will start the web interface with a CPU usage graph
on [http://localhost:6061](http://localhost:6061).

To view heap metrics, run `make pprof-heap-web`, which will start the web interface with a Heap usage graph.
on [http://localhost:6062](http://localhost:6062).

#### Error: Kubernetes cluster unreachable: invalid configuration: no configuration has been provided

If you run into this error while creating a test cluster run `make terraform-clean`.

#### Error: project: required field is not set Error: Invalid value for network: project: required field is not set

Run `make gcloud-init`. If you still get the same error, log into the developer
shell `make shell` and run `gcloud init`.

#### Error: could not download chart: failed to download "https://agones.dev/chart/stable/agones-1.28.0.tgz"

Run `helm repo add agones https://agones.dev/chart/stable` followed by `helm repo update` which will add
the latest stable version of the agones tar file to your ~/.cache/helm/repository/.

#### Invalid argument "/agones-controller:1.29.0-961d8ae-amd64" for "-t, --tag" flag: invalid reference format

The $(REGISTRY) variable is not set in ~/agones/build/Makefile. For GKE follow instructions under [Running a Test Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster](#running-a-test-google-kubernetes-engine-cluster) for creating a registry and exporting the path to the registry.
