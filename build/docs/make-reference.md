# Make Reference Guide

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for all make variables and targets in the Agones build system.

## Make Variable Reference

### VERSION
The version of this build. Version defaults to the short hash of the latest commit.

### REGISTRY
The registry that is being used to store docker images. It doesn't have default value and has to be set explicitly.

### CHARTS_REGISTRY
The chart registry that is being used to store helm charts. It doesn't have default value and has to be set explicitly.
If not set it would use the `GCP_BUCKET_CHARTS`.

### KUBECONFIG
The Kubernetes config file used to access the cluster. Defaults to `~/.kube/config` - the file used by default by kubectl.

### CLUSTER_NAME
The (gcloud) test cluster that is being worked against. Defaults to `test-cluster`.

### GCP_PROJECT
Your GCP project for deploying GKE cluster. Defaults to gcloud default project settings.

### GKE_PASSWORD
If specified basic authentication would be enabled for your cluster with username "admin".
Empty string `""` would disable basic authentication.

### IMAGE_PULL_SECRET
The name of the secret required to pull the Agones images, if needed.
If unset, no pull secret will be used.

### IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_FILE
The full path of the file containing the secret for pulling the Agones images, in case it's needed.

If set, `make install` will install this secret in both the `agones-system` (for pulling the controller image)
and `default` (for pulling the sdk image) repositories.

### WITH_WINDOWS
Build Windows container images for Agones.

This option is enabled by default via implicit `make WITH_WINDOWS=1 build-images`.
To disable, use `make WITH_WINDOWS=0 build-images`.

### WINDOWS_VERSIONS

Installs the current development version of Agones into the Kubernetes cluster.
Use this instead of `make install`, as it disables PullAlways on the install.yaml

#### `make minikube-push`

Push the local Agones Docker images that have already been built
via `make build` or `make build-images` into the "agones" minikube instance with `minikube cache add`

Runs end-to-end tests on the previously installed version of Agones.
These tests validate Agones flow from start to finish.

⚠ Running all the e2e tests can often overwhelm a local minikube cluster, so use at your own risk. You should look at
[Running Individual End-to-End Tests](building-testing.md#running-individual-end-to-end-tests) to run tests on a case by case basis.

#### `make minikube-shell`
Connecting to Minikube requires so enhanced permissions, so use this target
instead of `make shell` to start an interactive shell for development on Minikube.

#### `make minikube-controller-portforward`
